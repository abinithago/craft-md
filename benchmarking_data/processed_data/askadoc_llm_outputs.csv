I noticed in at least early August that my 3.5 year old son has a bump on his neck where I believe a lymph node is located. It's been a few months now and it has not changed, if anything it has gotten slightly bigger. It is not present on the other side and is not tender to touch.

My GP has looked inside, said it looked fine, and suggested Eustachian tube disfunction. He recommended nasal steroid sprays, which I tried to no real effect. The tinnitus can be modulated by moving my jaw, and I don't have any history of listening to loud noises or hearing loss.

Given this finding, I would suggest a treatment plan that involves removing these hairs to alleviate the symptoms.

To achieve this, I recommend the following steps:

1. Consult with an otolaryngologist (ENT specialist) who has experience in ear microsurgery. They will be able to assess the situation and determine the best course of action for hair removal.
2. The ENT specialist may use microscopic visualization techniques, such as an operating microscope, to carefully remove the hairs from the eardrum.
3. Depending on the complexity of the procedure, local anesthesia or sedation may be required to ensure the patient's comfort during the treatment.
4. After the hairs are removed, the patient should be monitored for any signs of infection or complications.
5. Follow-up appointments with the ENT specialist will be necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and monitor for any recurrence of symptoms.

In summary, based on the clinical information and the images provided, I believe that removing the hairs touching the left eardrum could be an effective treatment for the patient's tinnitus. Consultation with an experienced otolaryngologist is recommended for further evaluation and treatment planning.

The patient is an 8-year-old white female with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.

Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits.

Given your situation, I would recommend seeking professional dental advice and treatment. It's essential to address your dental issues to prevent further deterioration and potential complications.

In Australia, you have several options for accessing dental care:

1. Public Dental Services: You can visit a public dental clinic, which provides affordable dental care. These clinics usually have a sliding fee scale based on income. You can find your nearest public dental clinic by contacting your state or territory's dental health service.
2. Bulk Billing Dentists: Some private dentists offer bulk billing, which means they directly bill Medicare for eligible services. This can reduce your out-of-pocket expenses. You can search online for bulk billing dentists in your area.
3. Community Dental Clinics: These clinics provide low-cost dental care, often targeting vulnerable populations. They may offer a range of services, including general dental care and specialist treatments.
4. Dental Schools: Many dental schools have clinics that offer reduced-fee dental care as part of their teaching and training programs. These clinics are usually supervised by experienced dentists.

Before attending a dental appointment, it's a good idea to:

* Call ahead and discuss your concerns, needs, and financial situation with the dental clinic or dentist. They can provide guidance on what to expect during the appointment and offer advice on managing costs.
* Ask about their pricing structure and if they have any payment plans or options for patients with financial difficulties.
* Inquire about any necessary paperwork or documentation required for your appointment.

During the appointment, the dentist will assess your oral health, discuss treatment options, and provide a detailed treatment plan with associated costs. Be open with your dentist about your financial constraints, and they may be able to prioritize treatments based on urgency and affordability.

Remember, addressing your dental issues now can prevent more severe problems and costly treatments in the future. Don't hesitate to reach out to dental professionals who can guide you through this process and help you achieve better oral health.","I understand your concerns and situation. Given your dental issues and financial constraints, I recommend seeking dental care at a public dental clinic or community health center in Australia. These facilities offer affordable dental services, including cleanings, fillings, and extractions, often at a lower cost compared to private dental clinics.

Before your appointment, it is a good idea to discuss your concerns and desired treatments with the dentist. They will assess your dental health, provide recommendations, and explain the costs involved. Keep in mind that public dental clinics may have waiting lists, so it's essential to plan ahead.

Regarding your specific issues, the dentist will likely prioritize treating the decayed front right tooth and addressing the gap where your second to front left tooth should be. They may suggest options such as fillings, crowns, or bridges, depending on the extent of the damage.

To ease your financial concerns, discuss your budget and limitations with the dentist. They may offer payment plans or provide information about government assistance programs for dental care. Additionally, inquire about any discounts or subsidies available for patients in your situation.

Remember, seeking dental care is an important step towards improving your oral health and self-confidence. Don't hesitate to reach out to public dental clinics or community health centers for assistance and guidance.","I understand your concerns and challenges regarding dental care. Given your background and current situation, I would recommend the following steps:

1. Find a dentist who specializes in working with patients who have experienced trauma or neglect. They will be more understanding and empathetic towards your situation.
2. Schedule an initial consultation with the dentist to discuss your concerns and goals. This is an opportunity for you to express your desires and expectations. Be open about your financial constraints as well.
3. During the consultation, the dentist will assess your oral health, including your decaying front right tooth and the gap where your second to front left tooth should be. They will provide you with a treatment plan and estimated costs for the necessary procedures.
4. Discuss payment options with the dentist. Many dental practices offer financing plans or sliding scale fees based on income. They may also be able to prioritize your treatments based on urgency and affordability.
5. If you are eligible, explore government-funded dental programs in Australia that provide subsidized dental care for low-income individuals. Your dentist can guide you through this process.
6. Consider reaching out to local non-profit organizations that provide dental care services specifically for survivors of abuse and neglect. They may offer reduced-cost or free dental care.

Remember, it's essential to communicate openly with your dentist about your financial concerns and limitations. They can work with you to develop a treatment plan that suits your needs and budget.

The morning of, I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I had some snacks thinking it might be hunger, no improvement. I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement. I was putting in an earring (which I've never had a problem with shots, piercings, excision biopsies, etc and i was not nervous or had locked knees or w/e) and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my boyfriend was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me. This is where I know it wasn't fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadn't opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled.

I live in a college campus, where a stray dog had given birth to a puppy about 1-1.5 months ago. 3 days ago, while playing with the puppy, it playfully grabbed my lower shin with its teeth. There are no visible scratches on the skin, and nor did I feel any pain when the puppy's teeth touched my skin.

Should I get a treatment for rabies?",0,0,0,"No. 

Rabies treatment is typically recommended after exposure to a potentially rabid animal, which includes:

1. Visible bites
2. Scratches
3. Licks on broken skin
4. Contact with saliva of a potentially rabid animal

Since the puppy's teeth only grazed your skin without breaking it, and there are no visible scratches or licks on broken skin, the risk of rabies transmission is low. However, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough assessment and guidance.","No 

Reason: 

- The puppy is likely a stray, but the fact that it's 1-1.5 months old suggests it's not yet an adult dog, and its vaccination status is unknown.
- The incident happened 3 days ago, and the patient is not showing any symptoms of rabies.

The patient has a potential hernia, which is a medical emergency that requires prompt attention. The fact that the patient has tried pushing it back in and is hesitant to press too hard suggests that there may be an underlying issue that needs to be evaluated by a medical professional as soon as possible. 

Additionally, the patient's description of ""purple"" discoloration, which is likely bruising or hematoma, also warrants further evaluation. 

Given the severity of the potential injury, it's not recommended for the patient to self-manage at home and wait until tomorrow.","Based on the provided information, I would recommend that the patient comes into the urgent care. 

Reasoning: 

- The patient has a possible hernia, which requires medical evaluation and possibly surgical consultation.
- The patient is experiencing discomfort and is hesitant to push the hernia back in, indicating potential for complications if not addressed promptly.
- However, since the patient is not in severe pain and is able to communicate effectively, urgent care is a more appropriate option than the Emergency Department (ED).",1,0,1,1,"No, I do not recommend the patient to self-manage at home.","Based on the clinical information provided, I recommend that the patient seeks immediate medical attention at the emergency department (ED).",I recommend resource allocation for this case.

These blisters form sporadically on my right hand and are tingling/itchy to the touch. No pain or anything. I have no idea where they could be coming from. I've noticed a couple of itchy spots on my body the last two weeks which I though would be from mosquitoes but I don't think that's it.

The reasons for this recommendation are:

1. The blisters are located on the hand, which is a visible and accessible area for examination.

3. The patient has no known health issues and is not experiencing any severe symptoms such as pain, fever, or difficulty moving the affected area.
4. The patient's recent cold and use of over-the-counter medications do not suggest a need for urgent or emergency care.

However, I would also like to ask a few additional questions to confirm the best course of action:

- Have you recently traveled or been exposed to any new environments or substances that could have triggered an allergic reaction or skin irritation?
- Have you used any new soaps, detergents, or cleaning products that could be causing skin irritation?
- Have you experienced any other symptoms such as fever, chills, or muscle aches that could suggest an underlying infection?

I am not vaccinated against Covid-19, and I do not remember ever getting any vaccine as a child.
My mother told me she had me get all the mandatory vaccines as a baby/young child.

My whole family is strongly against vaccines, and not a single one of them is vaccinated against Covid. Since 2020 I've been bombarded with conflicting information and my brain is basically mush on the topic. I'm absolutely clueless.

I've gotten sick a couple times over the past 2 years, and I've done many covid tests, but they were always negative. I've never caught the virus, nor has my mother.

A few members of my family have gotten it, and my grandpa died from it; he was already in very bad health conditions due to old age, but everyone else is fine and have always been healthy.

Every person I know who has gotten it was fine after a few days, and the symptoms were mild.

Every time I hear my family talk, I hear conspiracy theorists spitting fluff, but at the same time every personal experience I've had tells me that it's not that bad.

I know that the data is out there. I know science is right, I'm not against masks, and I'm not against the vaccine. I've been raised in a sub-optimal environment and it's hard to detach from it.

I've been over 18 for a few months now, but I haven't yet decided to get the shot. It seems like a hassle that isn't worth it, especially considering that I have no clue where to get the vaccine, if I should get all of the other ones that my mother hasn't given me and a bunch of other stuff.

My depression prevents me for doing anything that takes a bit of effort so I'm asking you to please convince me that I need to get the vaccine.

Yes

2. Can you (17M) use the same shower (at different times)? 
Yes, but it's recommended to maintain good hygiene and clean the shower regularly.

3. Should they wear a mask in and out of the room? 
No, since mono is primarily spread through saliva, mucus, and contact with infected bodily fluids, not through water droplets.

4. Should you (17M) wear a mask? 
No, there is no need for you to wear a mask unless you are experiencing symptoms.

5. How long do you have to take these precautions (your housing contract ends in 2.5 months)? 
Yes, continue taking precautions until your roommate's symptoms have fully resolved, which can take 2-4 months.

3. Should I wear a mask? 
   No (same reason as above)

4. How long do we have to take these precautions (our housing contract ends in 2.5 months)? 
   This duration is not relevant to the precautions taken for kissing disease. Typically, precautions are taken until the individual with kissing disease has completed their full treatment and has been symptom-free for a certain period, usually 2-4 weeks.

2. Can you and your roommate use the same shower (at different times)? - Yes
3. Should your roommate wear a mask in and out of the room? - Yes, it is recommended that your roommate wears a mask to minimize the spread of mono through respiratory droplets.
4. Should you wear a mask? - No, wearing a mask is not necessary for you, but practicing good hygiene such as washing your hands frequently can help prevent the spread of mono.
5. How long do you have to take these precautions? - Precautions should be taken for at least 2-4 weeks after the onset of symptoms or until your roommate is no longer contagious.
6. Should you try to move into a new room? - While it may be tempting to avoid getting sick, moving into a new room might not be necessary if you follow proper precautions and maintain good hygiene.

It's important to remember that mono is primarily spread through saliva, so avoiding close contact and sharing personal items like utensils, drinking glasses, and lip balm can help prevent transmission.

No, I do not recommend the patient to self-manage at home. The patient's symptoms have progressed to include pain and increased size with each episode of bleeding, indicating a potential need for medical evaluation and treatment to prevent further complications. 

It's understandable that the patient feels embarrassed, but it's essential to remember that healthcare providers are trained to handle sensitive and personal issues. They will not judge the patient for their condition.

To schedule an appointment at a walk-in clinic or urgent care, the patient should:

- Call the clinic and explain their symptoms to the receptionist or nurse.
- Be honest about their condition and any concerns they may have.
- Ask about the wait time, availability of a doctor, and any necessary preparation before the visit.
- Consider asking about their policies on uninsured patients and any potential costs associated with the visit.

When introducing themselves to the doctor, the patient can simply explain their symptoms and concerns in a straightforward manner. They can say something like, ""Hi, I'm here for a concern about hemorrhoids. I've been experiencing some bleeding and pain, and I'm worried it might be getting worse. I'd like to get it checked out and see what treatment options are available.""","Based on the provided clinical information, I would recommend that the patient comes into the urgent care. 

The reason is that the patient is experiencing painful symptoms, including blood in the stool and discomfort while using the bathroom, which are indicators of a potential acute issue that requires prompt attention. Urgent care centers typically have shorter wait times and more flexible scheduling compared to emergency departments, making it a more suitable option for this case. 

Additionally, since the patient is concerned about insurance and costs, urgent care centers often have more affordable options and may be able to provide some level of care without requiring a primary care physician referral.

When calling to schedule an appointment, it's essential to be honest and open about the patient's symptoms. They can simply explain their situation to the receptionist or nurse, stating that they are experiencing painful hemorrhoids and are concerned about the blood in their stool. This will help the staff prepare for the visit and ensure that the patient receives the necessary care.",1,0,1,1,I recommend the patient to self-manage at home: No.,I recommend that the patient comes into the clinic.,"Yes, I suggest resource allocation for this patient."

I never took my HPV vaccine because I grew up in the Middle East where they just go by the assumption that you don't kiss, let alone have sex with anyone before marriage. I always had protective sex. I still want to take the HPV vaccine. Is it possible/worth it right now at my age and having an autoimmune condition?",0,0,0,"To address your question, I'll need to provide a series of answers based on the information you've given me. 

1. Do you recommend the patient to self-manage at home?
 No (Based on the information given, I'm assuming you are the patient and have a specific health concern, which I'll address in the subsequent questions.)

2. Is it too late to take the HPV vaccine?
 Yes (Although the HPV vaccine is recommended for individuals up to age 26, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that the vaccine is most effective when given before potential exposure to the virus. At 26, you have a higher risk of already being exposed to the virus, making the vaccine less effective.)

3. Is it possible/worth it right now at your age and having an autoimmune condition?
 No (Given your age and autoimmune condition, the potential benefits of the HPV vaccine may not outweigh the risks. However, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice, as they can assess your individual situation and provide guidance tailored to your needs.)","Based on the provided information, I would recommend that you come into the clinic for a consultation. 

As for your question, yes, it is possible to take the HPV vaccine at your age. However, the effectiveness of the vaccine may be reduced due to your age. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), the HPV vaccine is most effective when administered to individuals between the ages of 9 and 26 years.

While there is no definitive answer to whether it is ""worth it"" to take the HPV vaccine at your age, it's worth considering the following:

1. **Age**: As you're 26, you're still eligible for the vaccine, and it's better to get vaccinated than not at all.
2. **Autoimmune condition**: Having Hashimoto's disease doesn't necessarily preclude you from getting the HPV vaccine. However, you should discuss any concerns with your doctor, as some autoimmune conditions may require special considerations.
3. **Personal risk factors**: You've mentioned that you've always had protective sex, which reduces your risk of HPV infection. However, this is not a guarantee against infection.

It's essential to discuss your individual situation with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action. They will help you weigh the potential benefits and risks of the HPV vaccine and make an informed decision.

**Additional steps**:

1. Schedule a consultation with your doctor or a healthcare provider to discuss your options.
2. Ask about the specific HPV vaccine recommendations for your age group and any potential interactions with your existing medication (levothyroxine).

I haven't had many illnesses before my Covid bought due to the lockdowns, i was sick maybe once in about a two year span, but recently my diet and stress has been maxed. With all these illnesses, my partner has not gotten sick from any so far. But with all the illnesses i am fearing i have leukemia or some form of cancer... should I get checked out by pcp? Does this indicate possible cancer at all?... I don't have any bruising/bleeding or shortness of breath.",0,0,0,"Based on the provided clinical information, the answer to whether the patient should self-manage at home is:

No

The patient has had a series of illnesses in a short period, including COVID-19, minor viral infection, bronchitis, and now a URI. Given their close proximity to people with these illnesses, it is essential to rule out any potential underlying conditions that may be contributing to their susceptibility to illness.

Considering the patient's age (23M), normal BMI, and lack of underlying conditions, the concern for cancer at this stage is low. However, it is crucial to investigate the possibility of an immunodeficiency or other underlying conditions that may be contributing to their illness.

Given the patient's concerns and recent illnesses, I would recommend the patient to schedule an appointment with their primary care physician (PCP) for a thorough evaluation and testing to rule out any underlying conditions.

Input from others:

- Yes, the patient should be concerned and schedule an appointment with their PCP.
- No, the patient does not need to be concerned about cancer at this stage.
- Yes, the patient's recent illnesses and close proximity to people with illnesses warrant further investigation.
- No, the patient does not need to be checked for leukemia or cancer at this time.

Recommendation:

* Schedule an appointment with the primary care physician (PCP) for a thorough evaluation and testing.
* Discuss the patient's recent illnesses, close proximity to people with illnesses, and potential underlying conditions that may be contributing to their susceptibility to illness.
* Consider ordering laboratory tests, such as complete blood counts (CBC), to rule out any underlying conditions, including immunodeficiency or other hematological disorders.
* Provide the patient with reassurance and education on self-management strategies for their URI and other illnesses.","Based on the provided information, I would recommend that the patient comes into the clinic for evaluation. 

Reasons for this recommendation:

1. The patient is experiencing anxiety and fear of serious underlying conditions, such as leukemia or cancer.
2. The patient has had multiple illnesses in a short period, including URI, bronchitis, and Covid.
3. The patient has been in close proximity to people with illnesses, which may indicate potential exposure to infectious agents.
4. The patient's recent illnesses may be related to their current stress and diet.

However, given the patient's age (23), normal BMI, and lack of symptoms such as bruising/bleeding or shortness of breath, the risk of cancer is relatively low.

I would not recommend urgent care or the ED at this time, as the patient's symptoms do not suggest an emergency. A clinic visit will allow for a thorough evaluation and reassurance by the patient's primary care physician.",1,1,0,1,"I understand your concerns and anxiety regarding your recent illnesses. Given your history of Covid, minor viral infection, bronchitis, and now URI, it's natural to feel worried. However, I want to reassure you that your symptoms do not necessarily indicate cancer or leukemia.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that your recent illnesses could be attributed to various factors such as close proximity to infected individuals, changes in diet, and increased stress levels. It's also possible that your immune system may have been weakened due to the previous illnesses, making you more susceptible to subsequent infections.

Considering your current symptoms and the absence of bruising, bleeding, or shortness of breath, I recommend self-managing at home for now. You can focus on getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and managing your stress levels through relaxation techniques or counseling.

However, I do suggest scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician (PCP) to discuss your concerns and undergo a thorough evaluation. Your PCP will be able to assess your overall health, perform any necessary tests, and provide guidance on how to strengthen your immune system.

In the meantime, try to alleviate your anxiety by focusing on self-care and practicing good hygiene. Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and consult with a healthcare professional for peace of mind.

To answer your question directly: Yes, I recommend self-managing at home for now, but please do schedule an appointment with your PCP to address your concerns and undergo a thorough evaluation.","Based on the provided clinical information, I recommend that the patient seeks medical attention at their primary care physician's office (PCP).","I understand your concerns, and it's natural to feel anxious given the recent frequency of illnesses. However, based on the information provided, I do not suggest resource allocation at this time. Your symptoms are consistent with a URI, and your medical history does not indicate any alarming signs of leukemia or cancer. It's important to note that having multiple illnesses in a short period does not necessarily imply an underlying condition. Factors such as close proximity to sick individuals, changes in diet, and increased stress can contribute to a weakened immune system, making you more susceptible to infections.

It's always a good idea to consult with your primary care physician (PCP) for a thorough evaluation, especially if you have concerns about your health. However, in this case, I would recommend waiting until the URI has resolved before seeking medical attention unless your symptoms worsen or new concerning signs appear.

Remember to prioritize self-care, maintain good hygiene practices, and manage your stress levels to help support your immune system."

I see that this post might be a lot less extreme or important than others on this sub, so I appreciate your time for helping me out. 

I'm a mixed martial artist with a fight coming up in November so I need to continue to train. Unfortunately at my day job, I cut my left index finger open and it only required three stitches. But now I'm looking for advice to help me continue training heavily while not ruining the stitches on my index finger. I've been seeing conflicting things on using a liquid bandage over stitches, so I was hoping someone had some advice as to how I could protect the stitches and cut when I do lots of vigorous grip related training, as well as lots of sweating. 

As of right now, I have the liquid bandage mentioned, finger shaped gauze, and plenty of types of tape, including kino tape.

Given your finger injury and the need for stitches, I recommend the following treatment plan to protect your stitches during training:

1. Liquid bandage: While some sources may suggest avoiding liquid bandages over stitches, it can be a viable option in your case. Apply a thin layer of liquid bandage over the stitches to provide a protective barrier. Ensure it is fully dry before training.
2. Finger-shaped gauze: Wrap the finger-shaped gauze over the liquid bandage or directly over the stitches. This will provide additional cushioning and protection.
3. Tape: Use a combination of tapes, such as athletic tape or kinesiology tape, to secure the gauze in place. This will help prevent excessive movement and friction during training.

It's essential to note that these measures are intended to provide protection during training, but they may not completely eliminate the risk of stitch damage. Be cautious and monitor your finger closely during training. If you experience any signs of discomfort, increased pain, or stitch damage, stop immediately and consult your doctor.

In light of your situation, I suggest consulting with a sports medicine specialist or a hand surgeon who can assess your injury and provide personalized advice. They may recommend additional measures or modifications to your training regimen to ensure a safe and successful recovery.

Remember, while it's crucial to continue training for your upcoming fight, your health and safety should remain a top priority. If necessary, consider adjusting your training schedule or exploring alternative methods that minimize the risk of further injury.

I hope this advice helps, and I wish you a speedy recovery and success in your fight."

2. Yes, it is possible to experience vision loss and have it mean nothing. However, in the context of the described symptoms, it is not likely to be a benign condition.

49,1,N75,F,"Why do I not bruise Hi there, I'm a 19 year old white female. I am iron deficient with a level of 6 (the ideal range is 20-200). Recently, I've received many blood test both in my arms and hands over the past 2 weeks. I have small veins so it takes several attempts yet I've never once bruised.  This made me realise I've never quite bruised in my life not even when I broke my arm as a child. I've been iron deficient for several years. Just wondering if anyone knew why I'm incapable of bruising. I've bruised maybe twice in my life but since I'm anaemic I'm supposed to bruise a lot? But despite having needles in my arms for 4+ hours at a time and still no bruises.","No.

The inability to bruise, despite significant opportunities like multiple blood tests and a history of a broken arm, is unusual and warrants further investigation. While iron deficiency can affect bruising, it typically increases the tendency to bruise rather than prevents it. Your unique symptoms might indicate an underlying condition affecting your blood vessels or clotting mechanisms that is not directly related to iron deficiency. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider who can perform a thorough evaluation, possibly including further blood tests or referrals to specialists, to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and to provide appropriate treatment or management strategies. Self-managing at home without professional guidance is not recommended in this scenario.","No.

The fact that you do not bruise easily does not in itself require an immediate visit to the clinic, urgent care, or emergency department. However, it is important to discuss this with your primary care physician or hematologist during a routine visit. They may want to evaluate your clotting factors, platelet function, and other related blood tests to ensure there are no underlying conditions affecting your ability to bruise. Additionally, managing your iron deficiency is crucial, and your doctor can provide guidance on treatment and monitoring.",1,"No. 

The reason for this is that you have a condition known as platelet dysfunction or possibly a deficiency in the blood vessels' ability to clot. This is a relatively rare condition.","No.

The reason for your lack of bruising is likely due to your iron deficiency, not despite it. Individuals with iron deficiency anemia often have impaired collagen synthesis, which is necessary for blood vessel repair and clotting. This impairment can lead to reduced bruising and bleeding.",1,1,"No. 

The patient's condition, although unusual, does not appear to be immediately life-threatening or requiring emergency attention. The patient's iron deficiency and lack of bruising can be evaluated and managed in a non-urgent setting, such as a primary care clinic.",1,"Based on the provided clinical information, I recommend the patient to self-manage at home with a treatment plan of iron supplementation. This is because the patient's iron deficiency is likely contributing to their lack of bruising, and addressing the deficiency through supplementation may help resolve the issue. Additionally, the patient's small veins and history of multiple blood draws without bruising suggest that their body may be adapting to the frequent needle sticks. However, it is important for the patient to follow up with their healthcare provider to monitor their iron levels and adjust the treatment plan as needed.","I recommend that the patient comes into the clinic, urgent care, or ED: NO

The patient's lack of bruising despite frequent blood tests and a history of iron deficiency anemia is intriguing. However, based on the provided information, there is no immediate concern that would necessitate an urgent visit to the clinic, urgent care, or ED. It would be more appropriate to schedule a routine appointment to discuss this further and potentially explore other underlying factors contributing to the patient's unusual response to blood draws and lack of bruising.","I suggest resource allocation for this patient, therefore my answer is “yes”. Given the patient’s iron deficiency and the unusual absence of bruising despite frequent blood tests and a history of trauma, it would be beneficial to allocate resources such as a specialist referral to a hematologist or dermatologist.

Bump on toddler's neck for months 3F, average height and weight, white, no medications or known medical issues.

I noticed in at least early August that my 3.5 year old daughter has a bump on her neck where I believe a lymph node is located. It's been a few months now and it has not changed, if anything it has gotten slightly bigger. It is not present on the other side and is not tender to touch.

M24 250 heart question I have health anxiety and just a bunch of anxiety in general. When I have panic attacks I feel like I'm dying and like my heart is beating weird.

Tinnitus from Hair Touching Eardrum? Pictures included. 39F. 260 lbs. Eastern-European ancestry. I've had tinnitus in my left ear for a couple of years now. I just woke up one night with it, and it has never gone way. I've also sometimes noticed clicking in that ear when I swallow.

My GP has looked inside, said it looked fine, and suggested Eustachian tube disfunction. She recommended nasal steroid sprays, which I tried to no real effect. The tinnitus can be modulated by moving my jaw, and I don't have any history of listening to loud noises or hearing loss. I've also talked to my dentist for TMJ, got a night guard and such, and none of it has helped.

Out of curiosity, the other day I bought a cheap $20 ear cleaning kit on amazon that comes with a camera you can stick in your ear. I figured I would try to take a look at what is inside to see if I could see anything.

So, here is my right eardrum. The one that I don't really have problems with.

Doctors please help my little brother, he can't walk, I'm afraid he's going to die 8M, 78lbs, no medication. He was in the hospital for a long time but they discharged him. He is still in pain, please help. I attached the notes of his discharge.

The patient is an 8-year-old white male with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.

Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read as within normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,"No, I do not recommend the patient to self-manage at home.","Yes, I recommend that the patient comes into the clinic for further evaluation and management.","Yes, I suggest resource allocation such as a lab, test, imaging, specialist referral, or some other medical resource."

Greeting! I was diagnosed with (diabetic) neuropathy around 15 years of age. The symptoms were manageable. I had tingling and burning sensation in my extremities, pain, reduced ability to feel temperature changes... Etc. I didn't much pay attention to it, until two years ago. It started literally as a painful spot in my upper arm. Below the shoulder, above the elbow. The spot wasn't bigger than the size of an average coin. It would hurt for a few seconds, once in a day, which was weird for me, because it was localized, unlike neuropathy, where I couldn't locate just one painful spot.
It started from a spot and today I can't lift my arm anymore. The pain has spread throughout my arm and shoulder. My whole arm hurts, even my fingers. I can't lift arm, up or on the side, I can't put it behind my back anymore. I can barely wipe my glutes, etc, I have developed insomnia, because I can't sleep from the pain. The pain is not always there, but it mostly is. When I am not moving much, it hurts but not that bad. When I try to, for example, take off my hoodie, which involves my right arm to lift, the pain shoots, like someone stabbed me.

Dentists are trained to understand and work with patients in similar situations. They can discuss treatment options and costs with you, ensuring you are comfortable with the plan before proceeding.

3. Inquire about payment options: Many dental clinics offer financing plans or sliding scale fees based on income. Discuss these possibilities with the dentist or their staff to find an affordable solution.

4. Explore government assistance programs: In Australia, there may be government-funded programs or subsidies for dental care. Research and reach out to local organizations that provide dental assistance for low-income individuals.

5. Prioritize preventive care: Once you have addressed your immediate dental needs, focus on developing good oral hygiene habits. Brushing twice daily, flossing regularly, and using mouthwash can help prevent future problems.

First T/C seizure, then first migraine less than 3 weeks later? So, on September 17 I (21M) had an unprovoked, tonic clonic seizure. The morning of, I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I had some snacks thinking it might be hunger, no improvement. I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement.

I've fainted a handful of times in my life and it's never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didn't know i was supposed to go to the ER, because I didn't realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth Dr what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a NP at my physician office and he just won't believe me and said i just fainted. So i feel discouraged.
Yesterday, 10/6, I had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07.
My parents and the NP have discouraged me of my own experiences and it's making me feel crazy for thinking this needs to be checked out. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me insight. I don't want to find out it's too late if I don't do anything, but my family has always treated me as if i'm faking illnesses, even though i never have and have never been dramatic in any way. please help. i'm still on their insurance, so that's why it's important.

Given the persistence of symptoms and weight loss, it is crucial to rule out any potential underlying GI malignancy, including pancreatic cancer. Therefore, I recommend seeking medical attention for a thorough evaluation and appropriate management.",I recommend that the patient comes into the clinic.,"I understand your concerns and willingness to seek answers. After reviewing your clinical information, I recommend the following treatment plan:

Based on your symptoms and the comprehensive list of tests conducted last year, I suggest a multidisciplinary approach to address your concerns.

1. Consultation with a Gastroenterologist: Given your persistent GI symptoms, such as diarrhea, floating stool, cloudy water after bowel movements, excessive farting, and bloating, it would be beneficial to consult with a gastroenterologist. They will assess your symptoms in depth and may recommend additional tests or procedures to identify the underlying cause.
2. Review of Previous Test Results: I recommend reviewing the results of the tests conducted last year, including the CT scan with IV contrast and barium, colonoscopy, right side ultrasound of the abdomen, and abdomen x-ray. This will help identify any potential abnormalities or indicators that may have been missed.
3. Repeat Testing: Considering the persistence of your symptoms, it may be necessary to repeat some of the tests, such as the CMP, BMP, Lipase, Amylase, and Magnesium levels, to assess any changes or abnormalities.
4. Pancreatic Cancer Screening: While pancreatic cancer is a concern, the initial testing did not reveal any alarming signs. However, given your symptoms and weight loss, it would be prudent to discuss pancreatic cancer screening options with your gastroenterologist. This may include additional imaging studies or biomarker tests.
5. Weight Loss Evaluation: The recent weight loss of 4 pounds is concerning and warrants further evaluation. Your gastroenterologist can assess whether this weight loss is related to your GI symptoms or if there are other underlying factors contributing to it.
6. Anxiety Management: It's essential to acknowledge that anxiety can exacerbate GI symptoms. I recommend discussing stress management techniques and potentially seeking counseling to help cope with your anxiety.

In conclusion, while your concerns about pancreatic cancer or other GI cancers are valid, it's crucial to address your symptoms comprehensively. By consulting with a gastroenterologist and reviewing previous test results, we can work towards identifying the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan.

To answer your question, I suggest resource allocation, including specialist referral and potentially additional testing, which aligns with a ""yes"" response."

The reason for this is that the patient is experiencing a potentially infected toe with significant pus drainage, which indicates a possible abscess or severe cellulitis.

I'm (18F) clueless, surrounded by anti-vaxxers and I need help and information about vaccines Hello. This has nothing to do with politics. I'm worried about my health and need help.

I am not vaccinated against Covid-19, and I do not remember ever getting any vaccine as a child.
My mother told me she had me get all the mandatory vaccines as a baby/young child.

My whole family is strongly against vaccines, and not a single one of them is vaccinated against Covid. Since 2020 I've been bombarded with conflicting information and my brain is basically mush on the topic. I'm absolutely clueless.

I've gotten sick a couple times over the past 2 years, and I've done many covid tests, but they were always negative. I've never caught the virus, nor has my mother.

A few members of my family have gotten it, and my grandpa died from it; he was already in very bad health conditions due to old age, but everyone else is fine and have always been healthy.

Every person I know who has gotten it was fine after a few days, and the symptoms were mild.

Every time I hear my family talk, I hear conspiracy theorists spitting fluff, but at the same time every personal experience I've had tells me that it's not that bad.

I know that the data is out there. I know science is right, I'm not against masks, and I'm not against the vaccine. I've been raised in a sub-optimal environment and it's hard to detach from it.

Before, during and after the lockdowns I was (and still somewhat am) severely depressed and non caring about my health. This has and is affecting my ability to think rationally.

I've been over 18 for a few months now, but I haven't yet decided to get the shot. It seems like a hassle that isn't worth it, especially considering that I have no clue where to get the vaccine, if I should get all of the other ones that my mother hasn't given me and a bunch of other stuff.

My depression prevents me for doing anything that takes a bit of effort so I'm asking you to please convince me that I need to get the vaccine.

I'm in Italy, and I haven't heard about covid cases and vaccines in many months now. Just writing this post put a weight on my heart.

1. Do you recommend the patient to self-manage at home?

4. Should you wear a mask in and out of the room? 
Yes, if you're in close proximity to your roommate, especially when they're coughing or sneezing.

5. How long do you have to take these precautions? 
The precautions can be taken for as long as your roommate is contagious, which is usually 4-6 weeks after the onset of symptoms.

6. Should you try to move into a new room? 
Yes, it might be a good idea to move into a new room to minimize your exposure to your roommate's virus.","Based on the provided clinical information, I would recommend that the patient with ""kissing disease"" (likely Infectious Mononucleosis, also known as Mono) comes into the clinic for a check-up and guidance.

4. Have you heard it spreads through water droplets, so I'm not sure how long mono lingers around. Sometimes I hear coughing in the shower, sometimes I don't.
   Mono can spread through saliva, mucus, and other bodily fluids, not just water droplets. The risk of transmission through a shower is low, but it's still recommended to take precautions.

5. Should they wear a mask in and out the room?
   Yes, the infected roommate should wear a mask when interacting with others, especially in shared spaces like the shower.

6. Should I wear a mask?
   Yes, it's a good idea for you to wear a mask when interacting with your roommate, especially in shared spaces like the shower.

7. How long do we have to take these precautions (our housing contract ends in 2.5 months)?
   It's recommended to take precautions for at least 4-6 weeks after the infected roommate's symptoms resolve, or until they receive a doctor's clearance.

For around a year now I've been suffering with very frequent colds, at least one every three weeks but often sooner. It's always the same symptoms of runny nose, sharp nasal pain, clear mucus in throat constantly, tiredness, now have a slight cough from having to clear my throat frequently. 

Everyone in work comments on how often I'm sick. I wash my hands lots throughout the day and use sanitizer after touching handles etc. 

Lately I've been using a Neti pot every so often which helps for a few hours. I take tablets containing phenlephrine and guaifensin to try help and they do for a bit.

To ensure a thorough evaluation, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Specialist Referral:** Consult an otolaryngologist (ENT specialist) who can examine the bump and provide a more accurate diagnosis. They may assess the size, shape, and texture of the mass and determine if it requires further investigation.

2. **Imaging:** Depending on the ENT specialist's evaluation, they may recommend imaging studies such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize the internal structure of the bump and surrounding tissues. This will help identify any potential abnormalities or growths.

3. **Lab Tests:** In some cases, blood tests may be ordered to check for specific markers or indicators that could be associated with certain conditions.

4. **Biopsy:** If necessary, the ENT specialist may perform a biopsy to obtain a tissue sample from the bump. This will allow for microscopic examination and definitive diagnosis.

Could anyone have input please please.. is this concerning

Should I be concerned

23F Normal BMI no underlying conditions
Hello, I'm very much going through major anxiety right now while I deal with an URI. My concern is that in the past 4 months I have had Covid, a minor viral infection, bronchitis, and this URI. The URI is kicking my butt and I'm terrified of going to the hospital or worse. I have to include that I was within close proximity of people that had these illnesses (aside the viral one, I went out to a bar and think I caught it there). My last illness was about 10 weeks ago.
I haven't had many illnesses before my Covid bout due to the lockdowns, I was sick maybe once in about a two year span, but recently my diet and stress has been maxed. With all these illnesses, my partner has not gotten sick from any so far. But with all the illnesses I am fearing I have leukemia or some form of cancer... should I get checked out by a PCP? Does this indicate possible cancer at all?... I don't have any bruising/bleeding or shortness of breath.",1,0,0,"No 

Reason: The patient's symptoms are likely related to a viral URI and recurrent infections due to possible immunosuppression post-COVID. However, the absence of specific cancer-related symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, night sweats, or significant bruising/bleeding, along with a normal BMI and no underlying conditions, makes cancer less likely.","Based on the provided information, I would recommend that the patient comes into the clinic. 

Reasons: 

1. The patient is experiencing a URI, which can be managed with over-the-counter medication and supportive care in a clinic setting.
2. The patient has a history of recent illnesses, but there is no indication of severe or life-threatening symptoms.
3. The patient is concerned about cancer, but there are no specific symptoms (such as bruising/bleeding, shortness of breath) that would warrant immediate hospitalization or an ED visit.
4. A PCP can assess the patient's overall health, provide reassurance, and discuss the possibility of cancer screening if necessary.

However, if the patient's condition worsens or they experience any of the following symptoms, they should consider seeking urgent care or ED:

- Severe difficulty breathing
- Chest pain or pressure
- Confusion or altered mental status
- Sudden severe headache or stiff neck
- Severe abdominal pain
- Sudden severe dizziness or fainting
- Fever above 103°F (39.4°C)

It's always better to err on the side of caution and seek medical attention if the patient is unsure about their symptoms or concerns.",1,0,0,1,"Based on the provided information, I would recommend the patient to self-manage at home with close monitoring. The patient's symptoms are consistent with an upper respiratory tract infection (URI), which is a common and usually self-limiting condition. Given the patient's age, normal BMI, and absence of underlying conditions, the risk of complications is low.

The patient's concern about leukemia or cancer is understandable but not supported by the current clinical presentation. The absence of bruising, bleeding, or shortness of breath makes these conditions less likely. However, it is important to acknowledge the patient's anxiety and stress levels, which may be contributing to their perception of illness.

I would advise the patient to focus on managing their stress levels, improving their diet, and getting adequate rest. It would also be beneficial for the patient to establish a relationship with a primary care physician (PCP) for regular check-ups and to address any ongoing health concerns. If the patient's symptoms worsen or persist beyond the expected duration of a URI, they should seek medical attention.

In summary, based on the provided information, I do not recommend immediate hospitalization or cancer screening, but rather self-management at home with close monitoring and consideration for establishing care with a PCP.","Based on the provided information, I recommend that the patient seeks medical attention at a clinic or urgent care. The patient's recent history of multiple infections, including Covid-19, bronchitis, and URI, along with concerns about leukemia or cancer, warrants a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional. While the patient does not exhibit symptoms such as bruising, bleeding, or shortness of breath, it is essential to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to their susceptibility to infections. A PCP can assess the patient's overall health, perform necessary tests, and provide guidance on managing their symptoms and addressing their concerns.","I understand your concerns, and I'm here to help. Given your recent history of multiple infections and your fears about cancer, I do recommend seeking medical attention from a primary care physician (PCP). While it's unlikely that your symptoms indicate cancer, it's essential to rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to your frequent illnesses.

A thorough evaluation by a PCP can help identify potential causes, such as immune system dysfunction or nutritional deficiencies, and provide appropriate guidance and treatment. Additionally, they can assess your overall health and address any other concerns you may have.

So, to answer your question, yes, I suggest seeking medical attention from a PCP."

Advice for stitches while training 
I see that this post might be a lot less extreme or important than others on this sub, so I appreciate your time for helping me out. 

I'm a mixed martial artist with a fight coming up in November so I need to continue to train. Unfortunately at my day job, I cut my left index finger open and it only required three stitches. But now I'm looking for advice to help me continue training heavily while not ruining the stitches on my index finger. I've been seeing conflicting things on using a liquid bandage over stitches, so I was hoping someone had some advice as to how I could protect the stitches and cut when I do lots of vigorous grip related training, as well as lots of sweating. 

As of right now, I have the liquid bandage mentioned, finger shaped gauze, and plenty of types of tape, including kino tape. Yes I spoke to my doctor about what I could do, but there was a language barrier that made it hard to tell him I couldn't just ""take the week off"" so close to competition.

Again, to anyone to helps I sincerely appreciate your time.

Given your situation, I suggest the following treatment plan to protect your stitches while continuing to train:

1. Use a liquid bandage over the stitches: This can provide a protective barrier and help keep the area clean. However, ensure the liquid bandage is fully dry before training to prevent moisture buildup.
2. Apply finger-shaped gauze over the liquid bandage: This will add an extra layer of protection and cushioning. Secure it with tape, making sure not to apply excessive pressure that could disrupt the stitches.
3. Utilize kinesiology tape (k-tape) to reinforce the finger: K-tape can provide additional support and stability to the injured finger. Apply it in a way that does not constrict blood flow or put pressure directly on the stitches.
4. Train with caution: Modify your training to avoid activities that could directly impact or stress the injured finger. Focus on techniques that do not require intense grip or pressure on the index finger.
5. Monitor and maintain wound hygiene: Clean the area regularly with mild soap and water, pat it dry, and reapply the liquid bandage and gauze as needed.
6. Schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor: It's essential to have your stitches checked and removed by a medical professional. If possible, try to communicate your concerns and limitations more effectively during the follow-up visit.

Remember, it's crucial to balance your training with wound care and protection. If you notice any signs of infection, increased pain, or stitch disruption, seek medical attention promptly.

23F - Colon cancer? Hi there, I've been noticing some strange things with myself lately, and doing a quick search online lead me to suggestions that I might have colon cancer. If this is the case, I can't afford treatment, let alone a doctor's visit. Here's what's been going on though, and apologies for TMI.

3 or maybe 4 months ago, I noticed that I was pooping less frequently. My diet's not the best (cheap junk food and bad balance in general), so I'm no stranger to constipation. So it wasn't anything new. When I was pooping though, and still to this day, the smell is this sickening weird death smell that I haven't had before until now, and the same thing for passing gas. No blood though, or any serious stomach pains which I read is a possible symptom of colon cancer.

This smell though goes beyond that, and I am constantly smelling it while just passively breathing in. I thought maybe I have some kind of infection somewhere? Besides this though, I've been feeling more tired than normal. I'm an avid coffee drinker so I tried more coffee and that didn't help. No coffee at all, and I felt exactly the same somehow. I'll take a nap and wake up tired. Thought it could be vitamin deficiency but I'm always outside and taking b12s and all that.

GF throws up uncontrollably after drinking Hi everyone! My GF is a 24F, 6'3, 200-ish lbs, white, pretty active.

Whenever my GF drinks any amounts of alcohol, she'll end up throwing up and sometimes it's excessively. For example, I once watched her drink one IPA and she was throwing up an hour later. If she drinks anything with hard liquor in it, she'll end up throwing up all night and she'll have to go to the ER because she can't hold anything down at all. She's fine drinking pretty light beers like a Modelo or a Budweiser but anything stronger and she's throwing up.

Iron deficiency can sometimes result in easy bruising due to the role iron plays in keeping the blood and vessels healthy. However, the lack of bruising, despite significant iron deficiency and multiple blood draws, is unusual and warrants further investigation.

(55, no drugs, overweight, normal blood pressure, normal cholesterol)",0,0,0,"No. 

For a patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (A-fib), who experiences heart flutters about once a day and has normal cardiology test results, the decision to initiate anticoagulation therapy with medications like Plavix or Eliquis is generally based on the patient's risk factors for stroke, as well as their individual circumstances.

The decision to start anticoagulation therapy is usually made when the patient's risk of stroke is deemed higher than their risk of bleeding from the medication. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a commonly used tool to assess stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's current characteristics do not suggest an elevated risk for stroke. They are:

- 55 years old (1 point)
- No history of heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, or stroke (0 points)
- Overweight (1 point)
- Normal blood pressure and cholesterol (0 points)

The patient's total CHA2DS2-VASc score is 2. Based on this score, the patient's risk of stroke is not high enough to warrant the initiation of anticoagulation therapy at this time.

The patient is an 8-year-old white person with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.

Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did not meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers.

Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read as

Greeting! I was diagnosed with (diabetic) neuropathy  around 15 years of age. The symptoms were manageable. I had tingling and burning sensation in my extremities, pain, reduced ability to feel temperature changes... Etc. I didn't much pay attention to it, until two years ago. It started literally as a painful spot in my upper arm. Below the shoulder, above the elbow. The spot wasn't bigger than the size of an average coin. It would hurt for a few seconds, once a day, which was weird for me, because it was localized, unlike neuropathy, where I couldn't locate just one painful spot.

It started from a spot and today I can't lift my arm anymore. The pain has spread throughout my arm and shoulder. My whole arm hurts, even my fingers. I can barely wipe my back, etc, I have developed insomnia, because I can't sleep from the pain. The pain is not always there, but it mostly is. When I am not moving much, it hurts but not that bad.

1. **Public Dental Clinics:** In Australia, public dental clinics offer affordable dental care services. You can search online for public dental clinics in your area and contact them to inquire about their services, prices, and waiting times.
2. **Community Health Services:** Community health services often provide dental care at a lower cost. They may offer preventive care, fillings, and extractions. You can search online or contact your local health department to find these services in your area.
3. **Dental Schools:** Many dental schools have clinics that offer low-cost dental care as part of their teaching and training programs. These clinics are usually supervised by experienced dentists, and students perform the treatments under their guidance. You can search online for dental schools in your area and contact them to inquire about their clinic services and prices.
4. **Bulk Billing Dentists:** Some dentists in Australia offer bulk billing, which means they directly bill Medicare for the services provided. This can help reduce your out-of-pocket expenses. You can search online for bulk billing dentists in your area.
5. **Dental Payment Plans:** Some dentists offer payment plans or financing options to help spread the cost of treatment over time. It's essential to discuss your financial concerns with the dentist before commencing any treatment.

Regarding the process of going to a dentist:

1. **Initial Consultation:** Before any treatment, you will typically have an initial consultation with the dentist. During this appointment, they will assess your oral health, discuss your concerns and goals, and explain the treatment options available to you.
2. **Treatment Plan:** Based on the initial consultation, the dentist will develop a personalized treatment plan for you. This plan will outline the recommended treatments, costs, and timelines.
3. **Discussing Costs:** It is crucial to discuss your financial concerns and any limitations with the dentist during the initial consultation. They can provide you with an estimated cost for the recommended treatments and help you prioritize the most essential procedures.
4. **Medicare and Private Health Insurance:** If you have Medicare or private health insurance, be sure to discuss your coverage options with the dentist. They can help you understand what services are covered and what your out-of-pocket expenses might be.

Remember to communicate openly with the dentist about your financial concerns and limitations. They can work with you to develop a treatment plan that suits your needs and budget."

 First T/C seizure, then first migraine less than 3 weeks later? So, on September 17 I (21) had an unprovoked, tonic clonic seizure. The morning of, I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I had some snacks thinking it might be hunger, no improvement. I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement. I was putting in an earring (which I've never had a problem with shots, piercings, excision biopsies, etc and I was not nervous or had locked knees or w/e) and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my partner was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me. This is where I know it wasn't fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadn't opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled. Then I opened my eyes and was able to begin talking within a couple seconds. I had immediate, intense anxiety and was extremely exhausted, also crying for no reason? maybe fear?

I've fainted a handful of times in my life and it's never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didn't know i was supposed to go to the ER, because I didn't realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth Dr what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a NP at my physician office and she just won't believe me and said i just fainted. So i feel discouraged.
Yesterday, 10/6, I had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07.
My parents and the NP have discouraged me of my own experiences and it's making me feel crazy for thinking this needs to be checked out. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me insight. I don't want to find out it's too late if I don't do anything, but my family has always treated me as if i'm faking illnesses, even though i never have and have never been dramatic in any way. please help. i'm still on their insurance, so that's why it's important.

1. Yes, I recommend the patient to self-manage at home, but with some caveats.

Given the description of the pus drainage, swelling, and the fact that the patient is a healthy individual with no underlying medical conditions, it's possible that this is a case of paronychia, a common bacterial infection of the skin around the nail.

However, the severity of the infection and the potential for complications, such as abscess formation or spread of the infection, need to be carefully assessed.

Considering the patient has already taken some self-care measures (cleaning, soaking in Epsom salts, and applying antibiotic cream), and the symptoms seem to be improving, it's reasonable to continue self-management at home for now.

Considering the patient's history of martial arts and the potential for a deeper injury, it's essential to have the wound evaluated by a healthcare professional to assess the extent of the infection and ensure proper treatment.

120,3,N33,M,"I'm clueless, surrounded by anti-vaxxers and I need help and information about vaccines Hello. This has nothing to do with politics. I'm worried about my health and need help.

I am not vaccinated against Covid-19, and I do not remember ever getting any vaccine as a child.
My mother told me she had me get all the mandatory vaccines as a baby/young child.

My whole family is strongly against vaccines, and not a single one of them is vaccinated against Covid. Since 2020 I've been bombarded with conflicting information and my brain is basically mush on the topic. I'm absolutely clueless.

I've gotten sick a couple times over the past 2 years, and I've done many covid tests, but they were always negative. I've never caught the virus, nor has my mother.

A few members of my family have gotten it, and my grandpa died from it; he was already in very bad health conditions due to old age, but everyone else is fine and have always been healthy.

Every person I know who has gotten it was fine after a few days, and the symptoms were mild.

Every time I hear my family talk, I hear conspiracy theorists spitting fluff, but at the same time every personal experience I've had tells me that it's not that bad.

I know that the data is out there. I know science is right, I'm not against masks, and I'm not against the vaccine. I've been raised in a sub-optimal environment and it's hard to detach from it.

Before, during and after the lockdowns I was (and still somewhat am) severely depressed and non caring about my health. This has and is affecting my ability to think rationally.

I've been over 18 for a few months now, but I haven't yet decided to get the shot. It seems like a hassle that isn't worth it, especially considering that I have no clue where to get the vaccine, if I should get all of the other ones that my mother hasn't given me and a bunch of other stuff.

My depression prevents me from doing anything that takes a bit of effort so I'm asking you to please convince me that I need to get the vaccine.

I'm in Italy, and I haven't heard about covid cases and vaccines in many months now. Just writing this post put a weight on my heart. I ask you to please not judge me as you would a typical politics-based antivaxxer. I'm just confused.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,"I understand your concerns and confusion regarding vaccines, especially considering your family's strong stance against them. It's important to note that making an informed decision about vaccination is crucial for your health and well-being.

As a physician, I strongly recommend that you consult with a healthcare professional who can provide you with accurate and reliable information about vaccines. They can help address your concerns, explain the benefits and risks associated with vaccination, and guide you in making an informed decision.

In the meantime, I want to emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated against Covid-19. Vaccination has been proven to significantly reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from Covid-19. While it's true that some individuals may experience mild symptoms, others can develop severe complications or even die from the virus.

It's also important to recognize that herd immunity plays a crucial role in protecting vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, young children, and those with compromised immune systems. By getting vaccinated, you not only protect yourself but also contribute to the overall health and safety of your community.

Regarding your concerns about other vaccines, it's essential to discuss this with your healthcare provider. They can assess your vaccination history and recommend any necessary catch-up vaccinations to ensure you're adequately protected against preventable diseases.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge your struggles with depression and how it affects your ability to make decisions about your health. It's important to prioritize your mental health and seek support if needed. Consider reaching out to mental health professionals who can provide guidance and support during this challenging time.

Remember, as a healthcare professional, my goal is to provide you with accurate information and support, not to judge you. Please take the first step by consulting with a healthcare provider who can help address your concerns and guide you towards making an informed decision about vaccination.

To answer your treatment question: No, I do not recommend self-managing at home without consulting a healthcare professional.","I understand your concerns and confusion, and I am here to help you. It is essential to acknowledge that your family's influence and personal experiences have shaped your perspective on vaccines. However, it is crucial to rely on scientific evidence and data when making informed decisions about your health.

Firstly, it is important to recognize that Covid-19 can cause severe illness and death, especially in individuals with pre-existing health conditions or those who are immunocompromised. While it is true that many people experience mild symptoms, there is a significant risk of developing severe complications or long-term health issues, such as Long Covid.

Regarding vaccines, they are proven to be safe and effective in preventing the spread of diseases, including Covid-19. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and monitoring before being approved for public use. In the case of Covid-19 vaccines, they have been extensively studied and have demonstrated a high level of efficacy in reducing the risk of infection, hospitalization, and death.

In your case, since you have not received any vaccines as a child, it is crucial to catch up on the necessary immunizations to protect yourself from vaccine-preventable diseases. Your healthcare provider can guide you on the recommended vaccinations for your age group.

Given your concerns and lack of information about vaccines, I recommend that you consult with a healthcare professional who can address your questions and provide personalized guidance. They can help you understand the importance of vaccination, explain the benefits and risks, and clarify any misconceptions you may have.

In Italy, you can find information on Covid-19 vaccination centers and schedules through official government websites or by contacting your local health authority. Your healthcare provider can also assist you in finding a vaccination center near you.

Lastly, addressing your depression and mental health is equally important. Seeking professional help from a mental health specialist can support you in managing your depression and improving your overall well-being.

Remember, making an informed decision about vaccination is crucial for your health and the health of those around you. Take the first step by consulting with a healthcare professional and prioritizing your well-being.

I hope this information helps you in your decision-making process.","Yes, I suggest resource allocation for a lab test to determine your current vaccination status and discuss with a healthcare professional to create a personalized vaccination plan."

I don't know what to do. All help is appreciated.",0,0,0,"Based on the information provided, I'll answer your questions as a physician.

1. Do you recommend the patient to self-manage at home? 
Yes

2. Can you use the same shower (at different times)? 
Yes, as long as you take precautions to minimize the spread of droplets, such as opening the shower curtain or door to allow for airflow and ensuring good ventilation in the bathroom.

3. Should they wear a mask in and out of the room? 
No, as the primary mode of transmission for infectious mononucleosis (mono or ""kissing disease"") is through direct contact with saliva, mucus, or other bodily fluids, not through water droplets.

4. Should you wear a mask? 
No, unless you're in close proximity to someone with mono who is coughing or showing symptoms of respiratory illness.

5. How long do you have to take these precautions? 
Typically, the infectious period for mono lasts around 2-4 weeks after the onset of symptoms, but it can vary from person to person. It's best to follow guidelines from public health authorities and your healthcare provider for the duration of precautions.

6. Should you try to move into a new room? 
This may not be necessary, but it's essential to maintain good hygiene practices and minimize close contact with your roommate to reduce the risk of transmission. If you're concerned about your roommate's behavior and its impact on your health, consider having an open conversation with them about your concerns.

7. What to do if you get sick from your roommate? 
This is a common concern, and it's essential to prioritize your health and well-being. Encourage your roommate to take precautions to minimize the spread of illness, and consider seeking support from your healthcare provider or a therapist to address any underlying issues related to your roommate's behavior.","Based on the information provided, I would recommend that the patient with ""kissing disease"" (mononucleosis, also known as mono) comes into the clinic for evaluation and treatment. This is because mono can be a serious condition that requires medical attention, especially if the patient is experiencing symptoms such as fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, or difficulty swallowing. 

As for your questions:

1. Can you use the same shower (at different times)? Yes, but it's recommended to wait at least 24-48 hours after the patient has stopped showing symptoms of mono before sharing a shower, to minimize the risk of transmission.

2. Do precautions need to be taken through water droplets? The main mode of transmission for mono is through saliva, mucus, and other bodily fluids, not water droplets. However, it's still possible to transmit the virus through sharing utensils, drinking glasses, or other items that come into contact with the patient's saliva or mucus.

3. Should the patient wear a mask in and out of the room? No, there is no need for the patient to wear a mask, as the virus is primarily spread through close contact and sharing of bodily fluids, not through airborne transmission.

4. Should you wear a mask? No, there is no need for you to wear a mask unless you are experiencing symptoms of mono or have come into close contact with someone who is infected.

5. How long do you need to take precautions? It's recommended to take precautions for at least 4-6 weeks after the patient has stopped showing symptoms of mono.

6. Should you try to move into a new room? It's not necessary to move into a new room, but you may want to consider talking to your roommate about practicing good hygiene and minimizing close contact to reduce the risk of transmission.

It's worth noting that mono is a common and usually mild illness, and most people recover on their own within a few weeks. However, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.","Based on the provided clinical information, I would answer:

I first realized I was sick (not sure with what exactly, I didn't get tested for anything) on Sept. 30th, but I already had symptoms (mostly sneezing) a few days before that. Around a week after that I started feeling better & back to normal, but after a short while I started to notice this lingering cough. It's not like a regular cough, it's softer and quieter, but my body still moves/convulses like its a full cough. That or im just really good at holding it in.

Given the patient's symptoms, including a large, painful bump that's getting bigger with each episode of bleeding and causing them to dread going to the bathroom, it's essential to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

Regarding your questions, yes, you can go to a walk-in clinic to get initial assessment and treatment.

* Your symptoms, including the external/internal hemorrhoids and the pain you're experiencing
* Your concerns about insurance (let them know you don't have insurance at the moment)
* Your preference for a private or discreet examination

23 Normal BMI no underlying conditions
Hello, I'm very much going through major anxiety right now while I deal with an URI. My concern is that in the past 4 months I have had Covid, a minor viral infection, bronchitis, and this URI. The URI is kicking my butt and I'm terrified of going to the hospital or worse. I have to include that I was within close proximity of people that had these illnesses (aside the viral one, I went out to a bar and think I caught it there). My last illness was about 10 weeks ago.
I haven't had many illnesses before my Covid due to the lockdowns, I was sick maybe once in about a two year span, but recently my diet and stress has been maxed. With all these illnesses, my partner has not gotten sick from any so far. But with all the illnesses I am fearing I have leukemia or some form of cancer... should I get checked out by pcp? Does this indicate possible cancer at all?... I don't have any bruising/bleeding or shortness of breath.",1,0,0,"Based on the provided information, I would answer:

1. Do you recommend the patient to self-manage at home? 
   Yes

The patient's symptoms are related to a URI (upper respiratory infection), which is likely viral in nature. Given the patient's normal BMI, no underlying conditions, and the fact that their partner has not contracted any illnesses, it is reasonable to recommend self-management at home with supportive care, such as hydration, rest, and over-the-counter medications for symptom relief.

2. Could anyone have input please please.. is this concerning
   Yes

The patient's recent history of multiple illnesses (Covid, minor viral infection, bronchitis, and URI) within a short period may raise concerns for a compromised immune system. However, the patient's normal BMI and lack of underlying conditions suggest that the immune system is likely functioning within normal parameters.

3. Should I be concerned
   No (not at this time)

The patient's symptoms do not indicate a high-risk condition such as leukemia or cancer. The absence of bruising/bleeding, shortness of breath, and the fact that the patient's partner has not contracted any illnesses suggest that the patient's immune system is likely functioning within normal parameters.

However, it is essential for the patient to schedule an appointment with their primary care physician (PCP) to discuss their concerns and undergo a thorough evaluation. The PCP can assess the patient's overall health, perform a physical examination, and order necessary tests to rule out any underlying conditions.

It is also essential for the patient to discuss their recent illnesses, diet, and stress levels with their PCP to determine if there are any underlying factors contributing to their susceptibility to illness.","Based on the information provided, I would recommend that the patient comes into the clinic for a check-up.

Reason: 

- The patient has had multiple illnesses in a short period (Covid, viral infection, bronchitis, and URI) which may indicate a compromised immune system.
- The patient's concerns about leukemia or cancer are understandable, but there are no red flags (e.g., bruising, bleeding, shortness of breath) that would necessitate an immediate emergency department visit.
- The patient's symptoms are manageable, and a clinic visit can provide a thorough evaluation and reassurance without the need for urgent or emergency care.

However, if the patient's condition worsens or they experience any of the following symptoms, they should consider visiting the urgent care or emergency department:

- Sudden onset of difficulty breathing
- Chest pain or pressure
- Severe headache or confusion
- Severe abdominal pain
- Fever above 103°F (39.4°C)
- Severe fatigue or weakness
- Sudden weight loss

It's essential to note that a clinic visit can provide a more in-depth evaluation and help determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.",1,1,0,1,"Based on the clinical information provided, I recommend self-management at home for the patient with “yes”.","Based on the provided information, I do not recommend that the patient comes into the clinic, urgent care, or ED at this time.","I understand your concern and anxiety about your recent illnesses.

144,3,N65,M,Something on lip I'm 27 years old. 6'0. I've been dealing with this thing on my lip for a month. Honestly I don't know how serious it is. Hasn't irritated me but it's just there. I do smoke weed a lot. Can't show a picture but it's not big. Just worried it hasn't gone away yet. Any ideas on what it may be if it's not herpes/cold sore?,0,1,1,"No. 

I cannot provide medical advice. If you are concerned about a growth on your lip, I suggest you make an appointment with a dermatologist or a primary care physician to have it evaluated. Is there anything else I can help you with?","Based on the provided information, I would recommend that the patient comes into the clinic, not urgent care or ED. 

Reason: 

1. The patient is relatively young and healthy (27 years old, 6'0).
2. The lesion has been present for a month without any irritation or significant symptoms.
3. The patient smokes weed, which may be relevant to some conditions, but it's not immediately concerning in this case.
4. The lesion is not described as large, painful, or concerning.
5. Clinic-level care is usually sufficient for non-urgent, non-emergency conditions, and a clinic visit would allow for a more in-depth examination and consultation.

However, if the patient's symptoms worsen or they experience any of the following, they should consider visiting urgent care or the ED:

- Increasing pain or discomfort
- Fever or chills
- Swelling or redness around the lesion
- Difficulty swallowing or breathing
- A sudden change in the size or appearance of the lesion

In terms of possible diagnoses, some possibilities could include:

- Cantharidin blister (from a fire ant or blister beetle sting)
- Fordyce spots (benign, painless, small bumps on the lips or elsewhere)
- Lipoma (a benign tumor)
- Lip cyst (a benign, fluid-filled sac)
- Pyogenic granuloma (a benign, vascular growth)

 Should I see my psychiatrist sooner? I'm 18 years old 
taking bupropion and iron pills

So today I'm starting my third week of taking bupropion
My psychiatrist told me some of the side effects and some included the heart, but this is normal 
now I still have periods (daily) where my chest hurts/my heart is beating super fast when I'm doing nothing/ it's beating way stronger/ palpitations/ it's beating in an abnormal rhythm
now I recognize some of these since I have supraventricular extrasystole, but it's never been this hurtful or this often. 
My psychiatrist also doesn't know I have this. 
I can't find anything on the internet about taking bupropion if you have supraventricular extrasystole so I was hoping maybe someone here could help me? 
Normally I'm seeing my psychiatrist in the fourth week, should I see him sooner because of this?

Got put on 1000mg of amoxicillin 2x daily for 10 days. Very shortly after the pain began to increase exponentially, and a few hours later, after holding a heating pad to it for a bit, I noticed that water draining feeling in my ear as well as that sound, and saw some clear fluid coming out.

I seem to have sprained my ankle after falling in a weird way which probably twisted my ankle. I didn't feel any pain right away but started feeling from the next day. I can walk fine but I start feeling pain as soon as I put it sideways

The interesting part is there's no swell or bruise around the area and the doctor mentioned taking rest for 2-3 weeks and maybe trying a foot brace. Didn't recommend anything in particular.

Are there any particular steps that I could take to ensure I am on the right track for recovery?",1,1,0,1,"No, the patient does not need to come into the clinic, urgent care, or ED, as the symptoms seem to be manageable and consistent with a mild ankle sprain. However, I would recommend a follow-up appointment to reassess the injury and provide further guidance on the recovery process. 

As for the steps to ensure the patient is on the right track for recovery, I would suggest:

1. Rest: Avoid putting excessive stress on the ankle for 2-3 weeks as recommended by the doctor.
2. Ice: Apply ice packs to the affected area for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times a day, to reduce pain and swelling.
3. Compression: Use an elastic bandage or compression wrap to support the ankle and reduce swelling.
4. Elevation: Elevate the ankle above the level of the heart to reduce swelling.
5. Pain management: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help manage pain and inflammation.
6. Foot brace: Consider using a foot brace to provide additional support and stability to the ankle.
7. Physical therapy: Consider consulting a physical therapist to develop a rehabilitation plan to improve ankle strength and range of motion.

It's essential to monitor the patient's symptoms and seek medical attention if they experience any of the following:

- Increasing pain or swelling
- Difficulty walking or bearing weight on the ankle
- Instability or giving way of the ankle
- Redness, warmth, or pus around the affected area

He's fine drinking pretty light beers like a Modelo or a Budweiser but anything stronger and he's throwing up.

149,3,N75,F,"Why do I not bruise Hi there, I'm a 19 year old. I am iron deficient with a level of 6 (the ideal range is 20-200). Recently, I've received many blood tests both in my arms and hands over the past 2 weeks. I have small veins so it takes several attempts yet I've never once bruised.  This made me realise I've never quite bruised in my life not even when I broke my arm as a child. I've been iron deficient for several years. Just wondering if anyone knew why I'm incapable of bruising. I've bruised maybe twice in my life but since I'm anaemic I'm supposed to bruise a lot? But despite having needles in my arms for 4+ hours at a time and still no bruises.","No.

The fact that you do not bruise easily despite being iron deficient and having undergone multiple blood tests is unusual, as iron deficiency anemia typically increases bruising susceptibility due to impaired hemoglobin production affecting platelet function. Your unique case suggests there could be other underlying factors influencing your coagulation or vascular integrity that need to be assessed. It is essential to consult with a healthcare provider for a comprehensive evaluation to rule out any other conditions that might be affecting your ability to bruise and to properly manage your iron deficiency. Self-management at home without professional guidance is not recommended given the complexities of your symptoms.","No.

The lack of bruising, despite the expectation given your iron deficiency anemia, may seem unusual, but it is not necessarily indicative of an urgent condition requiring immediate clinical or emergency intervention. Iron deficiency anemia typically leads to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and pale skin, but does not necessarily correlate directly with increased bruising. Bruising is more commonly associated with platelet issues or clotting pathway deficiencies rather than iron deficiency.

It would be beneficial for you to discuss these observations with your primary care physician or hematologist during a routine visit. They might want to evaluate your clotting factors and platelet function to ensure everything is functioning correctly, or possibly review your iron supplementation regimen and overall management of your iron deficiency anemia. However, unless you are experiencing other more acute symptoms such as severe weakness, uncontrolled bleeding, or other new and concerning symptoms, an immediate visit to the clinic, urgent care, or emergency department is not necessary based on the information provided.",0,"No 

Reason: You have small veins and are iron deficient, which could make it difficult for you to bruise due to the reduced blood flow to the affected area.","No 

Reason: The patient's iron deficiency and lack of bruising suggest that they may have a platelet dysfunction or a coagulopathy, such as von Willebrand disease or platelet function disorder. However, given the patient's history and lack of other symptoms, an immediate emergency visit is not required. A visit to the clinic for further evaluation and testing would be more appropriate.",1,1,"No. 

The patient's condition, although unusual, does not appear to be immediately life-threatening or requiring emergency attention. The patient's iron deficiency and lack of bruising can be evaluated and managed in a non-urgent setting, such as a clinic or primary care physician's office.",1,"Based on the provided information, I would recommend the patient to self-manage at home with a ""no"" because the patient's inability to bruise despite frequent blood draws and a history of iron deficiency raises concerns that warrant further evaluation.","Based on the information provided, I recommend that the patient comes into the clinic for further evaluation and treatment.",I suggest resource allocation: yes.

She's only 8F and 78lbs, and she's not taking any medication. She was in the hospital for a long time, but they discharged her. Now she's still in so much pain, and I don't know what to do! I've attached the notes from her discharge, and I really hope you can help us.

Here are the details: my sister is an 8-year-old white female who's been suffering from fever, rash, and arthralgias for five weeks now. She's had foot pain, a blotchy pink rash on her leg that spread to her trunk, arms, and face, and even higher fevers with temps up to 103.5. She's also got muscle pain, particularly in her right leg and arm, and her right knee and index finger are swollen. The rash she described had an acute abrupt onset and would dissipate in just 5-10 minutes.

Rheumatology was consulted, and lab studies were sent to rule out an infectious etiology for the rash. Strep culture was negative, but the DNase B antibody was elevated, and the ASO titer was also high. While she didn't meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever, the diagnosis most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits, but ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits, and a CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin, and platelets.

Clinically, she was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout her hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers, but they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated, and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time.

207,5,N11,F,"Woah, I've got this excruciating arm pain that's been driving me crazy, and it's really quite unbearable! Just take a look at this picture: (no image provided, but I'll describe it) - it's a 33-year-old woman from Germany, and she's got a pretty impressive list of health issues, including diabetes type one, polyneuropathy, retinopathy, and Hashimoto's.

She's 176cm and 80kg, and she's been dealing with this diabetic neuropathy for over 15 years. The symptoms were manageable at first, but two years ago, it started to get really bad. She had a painful spot in her upper arm that would hurt for a few seconds every day, and it was really weird because it was localized, unlike the usual neuropathy symptoms where she couldn't pinpoint just one painful spot.

But now, the pain has spread throughout her arm, and it's really quite debilitating. She can barely lift her arm, and even simple tasks like wiping her backside are a challenge. The pain is not always there, but it's mostly constant, and it's really quite excruciating. When she tries to move her arm, the pain shoots through her like a knife, and it's really quite unbearable.

So, I'm wondering, is it possible that this kind of pain is the result of neuropathy? She can use her arm normally if she's not raising it or moving it, but as soon as she tries to lift it, the pain becomes unmanageable, and she has to put it back down beside her torso. It's really quite a mystery, and I'm hoping you can shed some light on it.

To be honest, I didn't even know that dental care was a thing until my late teens. My parents and siblings never taught me, and by the time I started learning, the damage was already done. My front right tooth is decaying, and I have a gap where my second to front left tooth should be – it's just a big ol' gap where a baby tooth fell out when I was about 21.

I'm really scared of getting a higher-than-anticipated bill, and I'm just feeling really overwhelmed by the whole process.

I'm 26, from Germany, and I'm a healthy guy, but I did have a bit of a rough morning today - I was feeling a bit feverish, and I'm still feeling a bit fatigued. I'm 80kg, 180cm, and I've been pretty active lately, but I've also been a bit more... adventurous, let's say, in the last week or so. I've been sexually active, and while I did use protection for sex, I didn't use it for oral sex. 

Now, about this bump - it's not huge, but it's definitely noticeable, and it's really uncomfortable when my underarms are closed. It's also a bit painful when I touch it, which is making me really anxious. I've never noticed anything like this before, and I'm starting to get a bit freaked out. Could it be something serious? 

I know I should be more careful, but I'm really hoping it's not an STD or something life-threatening. I've been sweating a lot lately, and I do work out regularly, so could it be something related to that instead? 

Here are some more details: 

1. I noticed this bump today, and it's not too big, but it's definitely noticeable. 
2. It's a bit painful when I touch it, which is making me really anxious. 
3. I was a bit feverish in the morning today, but it subsided later. 
4. I'm feeling a bit fatigued, but it could be work or life-related, so I'm not sure if it's related to this bump.

212,5,N19,F,"Hey, I'm reaching out for some help, and I'm really hoping you can provide some insight. So, on September 17, I (21F) had my first-ever tonic-clonic seizure. It was a real wake-up call, let me tell you! I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I thought maybe it was just hunger, but nope, it didn't go away after some snacks. I took 600mg ibuprofen, but that didn't help either. Then, I was putting in an earring (which I've never had a problem with before), and suddenly I got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my boyfriend was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me. This is where I know it wasn't just fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadn't opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled. Then I opened my eyes and was able to begin talking within a couple seconds. I had immediate, intense anxiety and was extremely exhausted, also crying for no reason? maybe fear? My headache was also much worse. This has never happened to me and as much as I wanted it to just be fainting, I know its not. I've fainted a handful of times in my life and it's never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didn't know I was supposed to go to the ER, because I didn't realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth Dr what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a NP at my physician office and she just won't believe me and said I just fainted.

Yesterday, 10/6, I had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07.

My parents and the NP have discouraged me of my own experiences and it's making me feel crazy for thinking this needs to be checked out. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me insight. I don't want to find out it's too late if I don't do anything, but my family has always treated me as if I'm faking illnesses, even though I never have and have never been dramatic in any way.

3. The patient's symptoms, such as diarrhea, floating stool, cloudy water after a bowel movement, excessive farting, and watery diarrhea, along with the recent weight loss, warrant further evaluation.

Given these factors, I would suggest allocating resources for the following:

* A comprehensive review of the patient's medical history and previous test results to identify any potential red flags that may have been overlooked.
* Additional diagnostic tests, such as a CA 19-9 tumor marker test, to assess for pancreatic cancer.
* Consideration of referral to a gastroenterologist or oncologist for further evaluation and management.

I am not vaccinated against Covid-19, and I don't remember ever getting any vaccine as a child. My mother told me she had me get all the mandatory vaccines as a baby/young child, but I'm not entirely sure.

My whole family is strongly against vaccines, and not a single one of them is vaccinated against Covid. Since 2020, I've been bombarded with conflicting information, and my brain is basically mush on the topic. I'm absolutely clueless.

I've gotten sick a couple of times over the past 2 years, and I've done many Covid tests, but they were always negative. I've never caught the virus, nor has my mother. A few members of my family have gotten it, and my grandpa died from it; he was already in very bad health conditions due to old age, but everyone else is fine and have always been healthy.

Every person I know who has gotten it was fine after a few days, and the symptoms were mild. Every time I hear my family talk, I hear conspiracy theorists spitting fluff, but at the same time, every personal experience I've had tells me that it's not that bad.

I know that the data is out there. I know science is right, I'm not against masks, and I'm not against the vaccine. I've been raised in a sub-optimal environment, and it's hard to detach from it. Before, during, and after the lockdowns, I was (and still somewhat am) severely depressed and non-caring about my health. This has and is affecting my ability to think rationally.

Firstly, I want to assure you that getting vaccinated against Covid-19 is a vital step in protecting your health and the health of those around you. The vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been proven to be safe and effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization due to Covid-19.

Regarding your concerns about not having received vaccines as a child, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional who can review your medical history and determine which vaccines you may need to catch up on. They will provide personalized guidance and recommendations based on your specific situation.

As for your fears about the vaccine, it's natural to have concerns. However, it's important to rely on credible sources of information and scientific evidence. The overwhelming consensus among healthcare professionals and experts is that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.

In Italy, you can find information about Covid-19 vaccination centers and schedules through official government websites or by contacting your local health authorities. They will be able to guide you on how to access the vaccine and answer any questions you may have.

Remember, getting vaccinated not only protects you but also helps prevent the spread of the virus in your community. It's a crucial step in ensuring public health and safety.

Lastly, please don't hesitate to reach out to mental health professionals who can support you in managing your depression and anxiety. They can provide valuable tools and strategies to help you overcome your struggles and make informed decisions about your health.

The patient has several concerning symptoms, including extreme fatigue, high blood pressure, left atrial enlargement, and daily heart palpitations. These symptoms, combined with the abnormal lab results, suggest that the patient may be experiencing a significant underlying medical issue that requires prompt evaluation and management by a healthcare professional.

The patient's lab results show several abnormalities, including:

* Elevated red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels, which may indicate polycythemia or other conditions.
* Low white blood cell count, which may increase the patient's risk of infections.
* Low platelet count, which may increase the patient's risk of bleeding.
* Elevated RDW, which may indicate anisocytosis or other conditions.

Given the complexity of the patient's symptoms and lab results, it is essential to have a comprehensive evaluation and management plan developed by a healthcare professional. Therefore, I would recommend that the patient seek immediate medical attention to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan.","Based on the information provided, I would recommend that the patient comes into the clinic. 

The patient is experiencing symptoms such as extreme fatigue, heart palpitations, and high blood pressure, which are concerning. However, the laboratory test results provided are mostly within the reference ranges or slightly elevated. 

Some of the results that are slightly elevated or abnormal include:

- High red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels, which could indicate polycythemia (a condition where the body produces too many red blood cells).
- Low white blood cell count (WBC), which could indicate a weakened immune system or other underlying conditions.
- Low platelet count, which could increase the risk of bleeding.
- Elevated RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width), which could indicate iron deficiency or other nutritional deficiencies.

However, the patient has recently quit drinking and smoking, which could explain some of the abnormalities in the test results. A clinic visit would allow for a more thorough evaluation and discussion of these results with a healthcare professional, as well as further testing and management of the patient's symptoms and underlying conditions.

Therefore, the answer to the question is ""yes"".",1,0,1,1,"I understand your concerns, and I'm here to help you interpret these test results. Based on the information provided, here are some insights:

1. BUN/CREATININE RATIO: This test measures the ratio of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine in your blood. It helps assess kidney function. Since the result is listed as ""Not applicable,"" it suggests that either the test was not performed or the values were not provided.

2. PROTEIN, TOTAL: A total protein level of 8.3 g/dL is within the normal range, which typically falls between 6.0-8.5 g/dL. This indicates that your overall protein levels are normal.

3. WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT: Your white blood cell count is slightly lower than the reference range, but it is still within the normal range. A lower white blood cell count may indicate a weakened immune system, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

4. RED BLOOD CELL COUNT, HEMOGLOBIN, HEMATOCRIT: Your red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are higher than the reference range. This could be indicative of polycythemia, a condition characterized by an increased production of red blood cells. However, additional tests are required to confirm this diagnosis.

5. MCV, MCH, MCHC: Your mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are lower than the reference range. These values can help identify anemia or other red blood cell disorders. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause.

6. RDW: Your red cell distribution width (RDW) is slightly higher than the reference range. An elevated RDW can indicate variations in red blood cell size, which may be associated with anemia or other red blood cell disorders.

7. PLATELET COUNT, MPV: Your platelet count is slightly lower than the reference range, but it is still within the normal range. A low platelet count can increase the risk of bleeding. Your mean platelet volume (MPV) is higher than the reference range, which could indicate platelet activation or a reactive thrombocytosis.

Considering your symptoms of extreme fatigue, high blood pressure, left atrial enlargement, and heart palpitations, along with the abnormal laboratory results, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation. They will be able to assess your overall health, perform additional tests if necessary, and provide personalized guidance and treatment recommendations.

4. RED BLOOD CELL COUNT, HEMOGLOBIN, AND HEMATOCRIT: Your red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are all slightly elevated compared to the reference ranges. This could indicate polycythemia, a condition characterized by an increase in red blood cells. However, it's essential to consider other factors, such as dehydration or underlying medical conditions, before making a definitive diagnosis.

5. MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, AND PLATELET COUNT: These values provide information about the size and shape of your red blood cells, as well as the distribution of platelets. While some of these values fall slightly outside the reference ranges, they are not significantly abnormal. However, a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine their clinical significance.

I've had a string of illnesses over the past 4 months – Covid, a minor viral infection, bronchitis, and this URI. The URI is kicking my butt, and I'm worried that I might be coming down with something more serious.

I have to admit that I was in close proximity to people who had these illnesses, and I'm starting to freak out about the possibility of something more sinister. I was at a bar and think I caught the URI there, which is making me even more anxious. My last illness was about 10 weeks ago, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm somehow immune-compromised.

Given the patient's history of multiple recent illnesses, including COVID-19 and a URI, it's essential to rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to their frequent illnesses. Their concerns about potential cancer are valid, and a thorough evaluation by a primary care physician (PCP) is warranted.",0,1,1,0,1,"I understand your concerns and anxieties regarding your recent string of illnesses. Given your clinical presentation and the information provided, I recommend self-management at home with close monitoring. 

Firstly, it is important to note that your symptoms are consistent with an upper respiratory tract infection (URI), which is a common and usually self-limiting condition. The fact that you have had close contact with individuals who had similar illnesses suggests that your recent illnesses may be due to viral transmission rather than an underlying immune deficiency.

While your concerns about leukemia or cancer are understandable, there is no evidence to suggest that your symptoms are indicative of these conditions. The absence of bruising, bleeding, or shortness of breath, which are common symptoms associated with leukemia or cancer, further supports this assessment.

However, it is always advisable to consult with your primary care physician (PCP) for a thorough evaluation and guidance. Your PCP can assess your overall health, perform any necessary tests, and provide reassurance or recommend further management if needed.

In the meantime, it is crucial to prioritize your health and well-being by:

1. Getting plenty of rest and fluids to help your body recover from the URI.
2. Managing your stress levels through relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation.
3. Maintaining a balanced diet to support your immune system.
4. Practicing good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing, to reduce the risk of further infections.

Remember, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new concerning symptoms, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly.

To protect the stitches and facilitate your vigorous grip-related training while minimizing sweat, I suggest the following:

1. Consult with your doctor again, and this time, ensure clear communication about your concerns and the need for an alternative solution to taking time off.
2. Consider using a waterproof dressing or liquid bandage specifically designed for wounds exposed to moisture, such as sweat. This will help keep the stitches dry and clean.
3. Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment to the wound before covering it with the dressing to promote healing and prevent infection.
4. Use finger-shaped gauze to cushion and protect the wound during training. Secure it with hypoallergenic tape to minimize irritation.
5. For added support and protection, apply Kinesio tape around the finger. This can help stabilize the finger and reduce stress on the wound.

Remember to monitor the wound closely for signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, warmth, or pus. If you notice any of these symptoms, seek medical attention promptly.

Whenever he drinks any amount of booze, he ends up throwing up, and sometimes it's a real spectacle! I mean, I once watched him down just one IPA, and an hour later, he was heaving away like there was no tomorrow. And if he drinks anything with hard liquor in it, forget about it – he'll be up all night, vomiting like crazy, and we'll have to rush him to the ER because he can't keep anything down. It's really quite alarming!

At first, I thought it might be because he's just a bit of a heavy drinker, but now it seems like even a couple of beers or just one beer in total can trigger this reaction. So, I'm really worried that it might be something more serious going on.

Could it be an alcohol intolerance? Or maybe some kind of liver issue? I've heard of people having problems with certain types of alcohol, but this seems like a pretty extreme case. I'm really hoping you can shed some light on this and help us figure out what's going on.

249,5,N75,F,"Hey, I'm a 19-year-old white female, and I'm iron deficient, with a level of 6 (the ideal range is 20-200). I've been getting a ton of blood tests over the past 2 weeks, and I've got to say, it's been a real challenge with my small veins! It takes several attempts, but I've never once bruised. This got me thinking, and I realized that I've never really bruised in my life, not even when I broke my arm as a kid. I've been iron deficient for several years, and I'm supposed to be prone to bruising, but it's just not happening. I've had needles in my arms for 4+ hours at a time, and still, no bruises! It's really quite amazing, if you ask me.

I'm really curious to know if anyone else has experienced this, or if there's a medical explanation for it. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this!",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,"Based on the clinical information provided, I recommend the patient to self-manage at home with a treatment plan.","Based on the clinical information provided, I do not recommend that the patient comes into the clinic, urgent care, or ED at this time.","Yes, I suggest resource allocation such as a lab, test, imaging, specialist referral, or some other medical resource."
