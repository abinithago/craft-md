Based on what you've told me, it's possible that you may have a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have a pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection that can cause inflammation in the reproductive organs, including the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.

In the meantime, it's important to avoid any sexual intercourse to prevent any potential complications.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your reproductive health.
