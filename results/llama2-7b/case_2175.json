{"case_id": "case_2175", "case_vignette": "A 67-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a fever and altered mental status. The patient has a history of Alzheimer dementia and is typically bed bound. His son found him confused with a warm and flushed complexion thus prompting his presentation. The patient has a past medical history of dementia, diabetes, and hypertension and typically has a visiting home nurse come to administer medications. Prior to examination, he is given haloperidol and diphenhydramine as he is combative and will not allow the nurses near him. His temperature is 102.9\u00b0F (39.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 104/64 mmHg, pulse is 170/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Physical exam is notable for dry and flushed skin and a confused man. There is no skin breakdown, and flexion of the patient\u2019s neck elicits no discomfort.
