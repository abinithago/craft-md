Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have developed a condition called shoulder impingement. This occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles become inflamed and irritated due to repetitive overhead movements.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, I would recommend an imaging test such as an MRI or an ultrasound. These tests can help us to visualize the soft tissues of the shoulder and detect any abnormalities.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend avoiding any activities that exacerbate the pain and taking over-the-counter pain medications as needed. If the pain persists or worsens, you should seek medical attention.\n\nFinal diagnosis: Shoulder impingement.
