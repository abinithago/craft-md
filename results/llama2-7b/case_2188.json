The fact that the burning pain in your leg gets worse when you walk downhill suggests that there may be a problem with the nerve that runs down the leg, possibly due to compression or irritation.\n\nI would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a specialist, such as a neurologist or a pain management specialist, to further evaluate your condition and determine the best course of treatment. They may recommend additional tests, such as an MRI or nerve conduction studies, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try avoiding activities that exacerbate the condition, such as walking downhill, and consider using assistive devices, such as a cane or walker, to help alleviate the symptoms. You can also try over-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to help manage the discomfort.\n\nRemember, it's important to seek medical attention if you experience persistent or severe symptoms, as nerve damage can be difficult to treat and may result in long-term disability"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient has been experiencing a burning pain in both of their legs for the past 6 months, with the left leg being the most affected.
