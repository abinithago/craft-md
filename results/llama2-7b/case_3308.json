Based on what you've told me, I would like to recommend that you schedule an appointment with a breast specialist or a general practitioner for further evaluation.\n\nThe new lump in your right breast that feels rubbery and has been present for about a month is a concerning symptom that requires further evaluation to rule out any underlying conditions that may be causing it. A breast specialist or a general practitioner can perform a thorough examination and order imaging tests such as a mammogram or ultrasound to determine the cause of the lump.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to keep track of any changes in your breast symptoms and to inform your healthcare provider of any new developments.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns, or if there is anything else I can help you with.\n\nFinal diagnosis: Schedule an appointment with a breast specialist or a general practitioner for further evaluation."}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient noticed swelling in her right breast for the past month. The swelling has been persistent, and the swollen area feels rubbery and moves around when touched, but it's not painful. She hasn't noticed any discharge, redness, or heat in the area. Her menstrual history isn't something that's come up recently, and she hasn't noticed any changes in her cycle. No, she's never had any surgeries or procedures on her breast, no implants or augmentations, and there's no history of breast cancer in her family. She's been taking contraceptive pills consistently over the past few years, but she hasn't noticed any changes in her breast tissue or other symptoms after starting or stopping them. She hasn't talked about her lifestyle and habits like smoking, drinking, sleep, or stress with the doctor yet. She's had the swelling in her right breast for about a month, and it hasn't changed in size or shape since she first noticed it; there's no redness, warmth, or discharge either. No one in her immediate family has a history of breast cancer or any other kind of cancer, and she hasn't had any previous breast problems or surgeries. She found a new lump in her right breast that feels rubbery, and it's been there for about a month; she hasn't had any illnesses or infections and there have been no changes in her menstrual cycle.
