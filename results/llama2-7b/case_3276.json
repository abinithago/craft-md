Based on your symptoms and concerns, I would like to recommend some possible causes of your abdominal pain and inconsistent bowel movements.\n\nOne possible cause could be irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is a common condition that can cause abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements.

IBD can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare provider to rule out any other possible causes of your symptoms, such as infections, tumors, or other medical conditions. A healthcare provider can perform tests and examinations to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some self-care measures to help manage your symptoms, such as avoiding trigger foods, practicing stress-reducing techniques"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient is experiencing abdominal pain and inconsistent bowel habits.
