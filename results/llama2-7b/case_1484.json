Based on what you've told me, it's possible that your baby may have a condition called \"gastroesophageal reflux disease\" (GERD). GERD is a common condition in newborns, and it can cause vomiting after feedings.\n\nHere are some possible causes of GERD in newborns:\n\n1. Immature lower esophageal sphincter (LES): The LES is a muscle that separates the esophagus and stomach. In newborns, the LES is not fully developed, which can allow stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus and cause vomiting.\n2. Incorrect feeding position: If the baby is fed in an upright position, the stomach acid can flow back up into the esophagus more easily, leading to vomiting.\n3. Overfeeding: Feeding the baby too much milk can overwhelm the stomach, leading to vomiting.\n4.
