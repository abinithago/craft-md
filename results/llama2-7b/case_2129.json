Based on what you've told me, it's possible that you may have developed acid reflux or heartburn. Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus, causing a burning sensation in the throat and chest. It can be triggered by eating large meals, lying down after eating, or being overweight.

In that case, I would recommend starting with a course of antacids to see if they help alleviate the symptoms. If the symptoms persist, we can consider other options such as acid reducers or even a prescription medication.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some lifestyle changes you can make to help manage your symptoms. Avoid eating close to bedtime, lose weight if you are overweight, and avoid trigger foods that can trigger acid reflux.\n\nAlso, try to elevate your head while sleeping by using extra pillows or a wedge pillow. This can help prevent stomach acid from flowing back up into the esophagus while you sleep.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with."}], "summarized_conversation": "A male patient reports experiencing a burning sensation in his throat whenever he eats large meals.
