Based on your symptoms, I would like to consider a few potential causes for your weakness and spasmodic movements in your legs.\n\nOne possibility is peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves in your legs. This can cause weakness, numbness, and tingling sensations in the affected limbs. Hot showers can exacerbate these symptoms due to the increased blood flow to the nerves.\n\nAnother possibility is multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. MS can cause a wide range of symptoms including weakness, spasms, and numbness or tingling sensations in the legs.\n\nOther potential causes could include vitamin deficiencies, such as B12 or vitamin D deficiency, or other medical conditions such as fibromyalgia or Lyme disease.\n\nI would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a neurologist for further evaluation and diagnosis.
