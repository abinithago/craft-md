Based on what you've told me, it's possible that you may have a condition called keratosis pilaris (KP). KP is a common skin condition that causes small, rough bumps to appear on the skin, often on the arms, legs, buttocks, and cheeks. The bumps can be red or brown in color and may have a rough, sandpapery texture. They can also become inflamed or infected, leading to redness, swelling, and itching.\n\nKP can be caused by a number of factors, including genetics, dry skin, and allergies. It can also be triggered by changes in the skin's natural oil production, such as those that occur during puberty or pregnancy.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a dermatologist.
