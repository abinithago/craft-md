Based on your work history and symptoms, it's possible that you may be experiencing occupational asthma or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which are common respiratory conditions that can affect workers in the construction industry.\n\nOccupational asthma is caused by exposure to asthma triggers in the workplace, such as dust, chemicals, or gases. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an inflammatory condition of the lungs that occurs after exposure to a specific antigen, such as dust, mold, or bird droppings. Both conditions can cause symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.\n\nIt's important to determine the specific triggers for your symptoms in order to develop an appropriate treatment plan. In some cases, avoiding the trigger or using protective equipment can help manage symptoms. In other cases, medication or other treatments may be necessary.\n\nI would recommend consulting with a specialist, such as an occupational lung disease specialist or an allergist, for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.
