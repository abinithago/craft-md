It can cause a wide range of symptoms including weakness, numbness, and tingling in the limbs, as well as vision problems, balance and coordination difficulties, and cognitive impairment.\n\nI would like to refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation and diagnosis. They will be able to perform a thorough examination and order imaging studies or other tests to determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend that you avoid any activities that exac"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient is experiencing weakness in the legs that has progressively worsened over the past 10 days, making it difficult to climb stairs and walk.
