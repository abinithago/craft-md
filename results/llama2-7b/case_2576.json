Based on your symptoms and medical history, I would like to consider the possibility of a benign gynecologic tumor, such as a leiomyoma or a fibroid. These types of tumors are common in the uterus and can cause symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding, abdominal pain, and constipation.\n\nI would like to refer you to a gynecologist for further evaluation and management. They will perform a thorough examination and may recommend additional tests such as an ultrasound or MRI to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend that you avoid any strenuous activities and take over-the-counter pain medication as needed to help manage your discomfort.
