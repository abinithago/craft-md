Have you noticed any changes in your visual acuity or sharpness of vision? For example, have you noticed any blurriness or haziness in your vision?\n3. Have you experienced any headaches or facial pain?\n4.

Based on the information you've provided, it's possible that you may have a condition called strabismus, which is a misalignment of the eyes. Strabismus can cause one eye to turn inward or outward, and can also cause headaches and other symptoms.\n\nIt's important to schedule an appointment with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) to have your eyes checked and to rule out any other potential causes of your symptoms. The eye doctor will perform a comprehensive examination to assess the alignment of your eyes and to determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, if you experience any changes in your vision or any worsening of your symptoms, please seek medical attention immediately.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions."}], "summarized_conversation": "A 5-year-old boy has been experiencing early morning headaches and nausea for the past 6 months.
