Based on what you've told me, it's possible that you may have developed presbyopia, which is a common age-related condition that affects the way the lens of the eye focuses light. Presbyopia can make it harder to see things up close, such as reading or using digital devices.\n\nI would recommend getting your eyes checked by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. They may recommend glasses or contact lenses to help you see more clearly.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some things you can try to help make reading and other close-up tasks easier:\n\n* Use good lighting: Make sure the room is well-lit and the light source is not too harsh or dim.\n* Adjust the distance: Try moving the newspaper or other material further away from your eyes to reduce the amount of magnification needed.\n* Use a reading light: Consider using a reading light or lamp to help illuminate the material you are trying to read.\n* Consider a magnifying glass: A magnifying glass can help en"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient visited an eye doctor with complaints of blurred vision in both eyes that had been progressively worsening over the past few years.
