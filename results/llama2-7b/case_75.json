Thank you for clarifying. Based on your description, it's possible that the light spots on your back could be due to a condition called vitiligo.

It's important to note that vitiligo is not contagious or cancerous, and it cannot be cured, but there are treatment options available to help manage the condition.\n\nTopical corticosteroids and depigmentation therapy are common treatments for vitiligo. Topical corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation and slow down the progression of the disease, while depigmentation therapy can help even out the skin tone by removing the affected skin cells.\n\nIn addition to these treatments, there are also several alternative and complementary therapies that can help manage vitiligo, such as acupuncture, phot"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents to the clinic with several concerns.
