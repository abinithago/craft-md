Practice deep breathing exercises: Deep breathing can help calm your mind and body. Try inhaling for a count of four, holding your breath for a count of four, and exhaling for a count of four.\n2. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can help reduce anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. Find a physical activity that you enjoy, such as walking, running, or yoga, and try to do it regularly.\n3. Use positive self-talk: Pay attention to your inner dialogue and try to replace negative thoughts with positive ones.
