During the exam, I will measure the volume of your tear film, assess the quality of your tears, and evaluate the health of your corneas and conjunctiva. This will help us determine the cause of your dry eyes and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help alleviate your symptoms.
