His mom reports that he has always been prone to bleeding from very minor trauma and that others in the family have had similar problems. Based on clinical suspicion a coagulation panel was obtained showing a prothrombin time (PT) of 10 seconds (normal range 9-11 seconds), a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 45 seconds (normal 20-35 seconds), and a normal ristocetin cofactor assay (equivalent to bleeding time).
