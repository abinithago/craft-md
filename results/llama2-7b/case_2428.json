They may recommend additional tests or procedures to help confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage your heavy bleeding:\n\n1. Use a heavy flow tampon or menstrual cup: These can help absorb excess blood and reduce the amount of bleeding you experience.\n2. Take over-the-counter pain medication: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce cramping and bleeding.\n3. Consider hormonal birth control: Hormonal birth control can help reduce heavy bleeding and lighten periods.\n4.
