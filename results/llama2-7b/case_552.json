Based on what you've told me, it's possible that the yellowish tint in your eyes could be related to a condition called cataracts.\n\nA cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye that can cause a yellowish tint to the vision. It is a common condition that can occur at any age, but it is more common in older adults. It can also be caused by other factors such as diabetes, smoking, and certain medications.\n\nI would recommend that you schedule an appointment with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) to have your eyes checked and to rule out any other possible causes of the yellowish tint in your eyes. They will be able to perform a comprehensive eye exam to determine the cause of the tint and recommend the appropriate treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, if you notice any changes in your vision or any other symptoms, please let me know."}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents to the clinic with concerns about the yellowish tint in their eyes.
