Based on your symptoms, I would like to consider a few potential causes for your blood in the urine and increased frequency of urination:\n\n1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): This is a common cause of blood in the urine and frequent urination. UTIs occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract and cause an infection.\n2. Kidney Infection (Pyelonephritis): This is a more serious infection that can occur in the kidneys and cause blood in the urine, fever, and flank pain.\n3. Bladder Cancer: Bladder cancer can cause blood in the urine and frequent urination, especially in older adults.\n4. Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS): This is a chronic condition that causes pain and inflammation in the bladder, leading to frequency and urgency of urination.\n\nI would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a urologist for further evaluation and diagnosis.
