Based on the information you've provided, it's possible that you may have a hormonal imbalance, which can cause changes in the appearance of the external genitalia. Hormonal imbalances can be caused by a variety of factors, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, and other endocrine imbalances.\n\nI would like to recommend that you consult with a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying hormonal imbalances that may be contributing to the changes you're experiencing. They can perform tests to check your hormone levels and recommend appropriate treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage the appearance of your external genitalia. Using a mild, fragrance-free soap and water to clean the area can help reduce irritation. Avoid using harsh products or waxing, as this can further irritate the skin and cause more inflammation.\n\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask."}], "summarized_conversation": "A 55-year-old patient presents with unwanted hair growth on the upper lip, chin, and chest, an increase in blackheads and pimples, a deeper voice, and weight gain.
