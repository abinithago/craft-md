The baby has been vomiting after each meal and their belly seems to hurt and is stiff. The baby is fed with breast milk and cow milk based-formula, but the schedule is uncertain. There was blood in the baby's stool and they are breathing rapidly. The blood in the stool is not something that can be described, but the baby's appetite has decreased and they have been less active, feeling really tired. Stools have been more frequent, and concerning the baby's diet, they are on breast milk and cow milk based-formula. The baby's belly is very tender and it feels very tight and hard. Stools are loose and watery, but there haven't been any changes in how often they pee. There have been no recent vaccinations or illnesses, and no changes to the baby's skin. The specific brand or type of formula is unknown, and the baby's appetite has decreased, along with fussiness. Additionally, the baby's diapers have loose stools with blood in them. The blood in the stools has been there each time, and about the breathing, it's faster than normal. The baby has been sleeping more and not eating as much, and their temperature has been a bit lower. The baby has been very sleepy and less responsive. Actually, the baby's temperature is a bit low, not high; it's 36.4\u00b0C (97.5\u00b0F). There haven't been any rash or muscle aches, and no changes in how often the baby pees. The baby has been less responsive and sleepier, and their breathing is definitely faster. Their breathing is rapid, and there haven't been any signs of wheezing or chest movement. The baby's appetite has decreased and they have been feeding less. Stools are loose and happening more often. The baby has become more lethargic and less responsive overall. There is no fever; the temperature is a bit low. There is no mention of a sore throat or cough.
