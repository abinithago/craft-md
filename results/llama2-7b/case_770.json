During a fugue state, a person may adopt a new identity and start a new life, often without any memory of their previous life.\n\nIt's important to note that dissociative fugue is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other conditions must be ruled out before making this diagnosis.

However, it's important to explore the possibility of stress and other psychological factors as a contributing cause, as they can play a significant role in the development of this condition.\n\nI would recommend seeking the help of a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, who can conduct a thorough evaluation and provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can help you identify any underlying psychological factors that may be contributing to your symptoms and develop strategies to manage them.\n\nIn the meantime, it may be helpful to practice self-care and stress management techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness meditation.

Based on your responses, it seems that you may be experiencing a type of cognitive impairment known as confusional state or delirium. This is a common condition in older adults, particularly in those who are hospitalized or have other medical conditions.\n\nDelirium is a sudden change in mental status that can cause confusion, disorientation, and difficulty paying attention. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, medications, alcohol or drug withdrawal, and chronic conditions such as dementia.\n\nYour lack of recognition of your spouse and family members, as well as your difficulty recalling important events and locations from your past, are all consistent with delirium. Your ability to recall basic information, such as the names of elements and the capital of the United States, is also consistent with delirium.\n\nIt is important to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, such as a stroke or seizure disorder.
