On physical exam, you note an uncomfortable elderly man. The patient responds to questions but his answers are inappropriate and he struggles to find the right words. Neurological exam is notable for an ataxic gait and nystagmus. Dermatologic exam is notable for scattered ecchymosis and the findings in Figure A. The patient is balding, and his hair seems very fragile and coiled. Cardiac exam reveals a systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids. Pulmonary exam reveals mild bibasilar crackles. Radiography is ordered as seen in Figure B. The patient is started on IV fluids.
