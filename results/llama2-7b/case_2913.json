Other possible causes of a mass in the left atrium include cardiac sarcoidosis, an inflammatory condition that can affect the heart, and primary cardiac lymphoma, a rare type of cancer that affects the heart.\n\nIt's important to consult with a cardiologist or cardiac surgeon to determine the cause of the mass and develop an appropriate treatment plan. They may recommend further testing, such as an echocardiogram or cardiac MRI, to get a better view of the mass and assess its size and location. They may also recommend a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn some cases, a mass in the left atrium can be treated with medication or radiation therapy"}], "summarized_conversation": "A 41-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath, particularly when lying on her left side.
