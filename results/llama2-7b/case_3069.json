Based on your symptoms, it's highly likely that you have alopecia areata.

They may perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options with you, such as topical corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or even hair transplantation.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can do to help manage your symptoms. Using a gentle shampoo and avoiding tight hairstyles can help reduce irritation and promote hair growth. You can also try using a scalp massager or a scalp scrub to help stimulate blood flow and promote hair growth.\n\nRemember, alopecia areata is a common condition that can affect anyone, and it's important to seek medical attention if you're experiencing symptoms.
