Based on what you've told me, it's possible that you may have a hormonal imbalance or a underlying condition that is causing your heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding, as well as the cyclical abdominal pain.\n\nHere are some potential causes that I would like to consider:\n\n1.

PCOS is common and can affect women of reproductive age.\n2. Endometriosis: This is a condition in which the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside of the uterus, causing inflammation and pain. Endometriosis can also cause heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding.\n3. Adenomyosis: This is a condition in which the tissue that lines the uterus grows into the muscle of the uterus, causing heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding, as well as cyclical abdominal pain."}], "summarized_conversation": "A 28-year-old woman presents to the clinic with complaints of heavy and prolonged periods, pain during sex, and regular abdominal pain that seems to come and go with her cycle.
