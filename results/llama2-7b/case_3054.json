It is characterized by episodes of sudden, intense pain in the face, usually on one side. The pain can be described as sharp, stabbing, or like an electric shock.

Electromyography (EMG) - This test will help us determine the function of the muscles in your face and the nerves that control them.\n3. Trigeminal nerve stimulation - This test involves stimulating the nerve that is affected by trigeminal neuralgia and measuring the response.\n4. CT or MRI scan of the brain - These tests will help us rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms, such as a tumor or an aneurysm.\n\nOnce we have the results of these tests, we can discuss the best course of treatment for your condition.
