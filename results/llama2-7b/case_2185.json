Pulmonary embolism is a serious condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in the lungs, which can cause blockages and reduce blood flow to the heart and other organs. Mild pulmonary embolism can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and coughing up blood, while severe cases can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and even death.\n\nThe treatment plan for pulmonary embolism typically involves a combination of medications and supportive care. Blood thinners, such as warfarin or heparin, are used to dissolve the clot and prevent new clots from forming. Pain medication, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help manage chest pain and discomfort. Oxygen therapy may also be used to help increase oxygen levels in the blood.\n\nIn some cases, hospitalization may be necessary to monitor and treat the condition. This may involve bed rest, oxygen therapy, and close monitoring of vital signs. In severe cases, thrombolysis therapy may be used to dissolve the clot quickly.\n\nIt'"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents with chest pain following a car crash.
