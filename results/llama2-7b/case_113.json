Oral herpes is another type of herpes virus that can cause similar symptoms. Both of these viruses are highly contagious and can be spread through close contact with an infected person.\n\nI would recommend that you see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. They may prescribe antiviral medication to help manage your symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can do to help manage your symptoms:\n\n* Apply a cold compress to the blisters to reduce swelling and pain\n* Avoid picking or scratching the blisters, as this can spread the infection\n* Use over-the-counter pain medication, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen,"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents with bleeding scabs on the lips and sores inside the mouth, around the private area, and red, painful eyes for the last two days.
