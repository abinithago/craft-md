Now she is suffering from a constant, uncomfortable burning pain on her left side for the past week. The pain gets worse when someone even lightly touches that side.

She confirms a history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and bilateral knee pain. She also had cardiac surgery 20 years ago. She denies fever, mood changes, weight changes, and trauma to the head, neck, or limbs. Her blood pressure is 162/90 mm Hg, the heart rate is 82/min, and the respiratory rate is 15/min.
