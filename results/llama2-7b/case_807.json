Based on your symptoms and test results, I would like to make a diagnosis of sudden blindness in your right eye, likely due to a retinal detachment.\n\nRetinal detachment is a medical emergency that can cause sudden vision loss if not treated promptly. It occurs when the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, becomes detached from the underlying tissue. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including injury, disease, or age-related changes.\n\nI would recommend that you seek immediate medical attention from an ophthalmologist or a medical doctor to confirm the diagnosis and receive appropriate treatment. Treatment options for retinal detachment may include surgery to reattach the retina, or in some cases, laser therapy to seal off the tear or hole that caused the detachment.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to avoid any activities that may exacerbate the condition, such as driving or reading. You should also avoid bending or straining, as this can increase the pressure in the eye and make the detachment worse.\n"}], "summarized_conversation": "A 25-year-old individual suddenly became blind in their right eye about an hour ago.
