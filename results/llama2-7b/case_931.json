Based on what you've told me, I would like to consider a few possible causes for your knee pain:\n\n1. Patellofemoral pain syndrome: This is a common condition characterized by pain in the front of the knee, usually around the kneecap. It can be caused by overuse, poor alignment, or weak quadriceps muscles.\n2. Chondromalacia patellae: This is a condition where the cartilage on the underside of the kneecap deteriorates, leading to pain and stiffness in the knee.\n3. Bursitis: Bursitis is inflammation of the fluid-filled sacs (bursae) that cushion the knee joint, leading to pain and swelling.\n4.
