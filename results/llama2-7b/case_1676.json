Removal: We will use a scalpel or a laser to remove the lesion. The procedure is usually quick and relatively painless. Depending on the size and location of the lesion, we may use a excision technique, where we remove the lesion and some surrounding tissue, or a shave excision, where we remove the lesion with a small blade.\n3.
