Based on what you've told me, I would like to consider a few possible causes for your rash and high body temperature.\n\nOne possibility is that you may have a viral infection, such as a cold or flu, which can cause a rash and fever. Another possibility is that you may have a bacterial infection, such as strep throat or Lyme disease, which can also cause a rash and fever.\n\nIt's also possible that you may have an allergic reaction or an autoimmune disorder, such as eczema or psoriasis, which can cause a rash.\n\nI would recommend that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to have your symptoms evaluated. They can perform a physical examination, take a thorough medical history, and order any necessary diagnostic tests to determine the cause of your rash and fever.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to manage your symptoms by taking over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to reduce your fever and relieve any discomfort"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents with a rash that started on the stomach and spread to the arms and legs, accompanied by a fever and a seizure a few days ago.
