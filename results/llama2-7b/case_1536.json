Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have a condition called psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that can cause red, scaly patches on the skin. It can also lead to patchy discoloration or darkening of the skin, as you've described.\n\nI would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a dermatologist for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can perform a physical examination and may take a skin scraping or biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some things you can try to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Topical corticosteroids: Over-the-counter or prescription topical corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation and slow down the growth of skin cells, which can help alleviate the symptoms of psoriasis.\n2. Topical vitamin D analogs: These are similar to corticosteroids but have a different mechanism of action. They can also help reduce inflammation and slow down skin cell growth.\n3.
