Changes to feeding position: Holding your baby in an upright position during feeding can help to prevent stomach acid from flowing back up into the esophagus.\n2. Exclusive breastfeeding: Breast milk is less likely to trigger reflux than formula, so exclusive breastfeeding may help to alleviate symptoms.\n3. Medication: In some cases, your baby's doctor may prescribe medication to help manage symptoms of GERD.\n4.
