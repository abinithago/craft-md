Based on your symptoms, it's likely that you have suffered a lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury in your left knee. The LCL is a ligament that runs along the sides of the knee joint and helps to stabilize it.\n\nLCL injuries can be quite common in contact sports such as field hockey, and they can cause swelling and instability in the knee. In some cases, an LCL injury can also cause a small fracture in the bone, which can lead to additional swelling and bruising.\n\nIt's important to seek medical attention right away if you suspect that you have suffered an LCL injury. A healthcare professional can perform a thorough examination and imaging tests (such as an MRI or X-ray) to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to avoid putting too much weight on your left knee and to seek support and stability using a brace or compression bandage. You can also apply ice to the knee to help reduce swelling and pain.\n\nI hope"}], "summarized_conversation": "An 18-year-old field hockey player presents with a swollen and tender left knee after being tackled during a game.
