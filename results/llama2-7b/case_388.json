Postictal syndrome: This is a condition that can occur after a seizure, causing weakness, numbness, or tingling in the affected arm. Since you experienced a shaking episode as a child, it's possible that you may have had a seizure disorder in the past, and this could be a sign of postictal syndrome.\n2.
