Based on your symptoms and treatment, it sounds like you may have a condition called dermatitis herpetiformis, which is a type of skin rash that is often associated with gluten sensitivity.\n\nDermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic skin rash that typically appears as small, itchy bumps or blisters on the elbows, knees, and buttocks. The rash can be triggered by gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.\n\nIf you have not already done so, I would recommend getting tested for celiac disease, which is a autoimmune disorder that can cause similar symptoms to dermatitis herpetiformis. A gluten-free diet can help manage symptoms of both conditions.\n\nIn addition to a gluten-free diet, there are other treatments that can help manage the symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis, such as topical corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and antihistamines.\n\nI would recommend consulting with a dermatologist"}], "summarized_conversation": "The patient is seeking help for a red, itchy rash on their elbows and shoulders that has been present for 2 months.
