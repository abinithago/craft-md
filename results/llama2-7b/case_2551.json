It can be difficult to identify the root cause of resistant feelings without exploring them in a safe and supportive environment. A therapist or counselor can help you identify the underlying issues and develop strategies to manage them.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help you cope with your resistance:\n\n1. Practice self-reflection: Take some time each day to reflect on your feelings and thoughts. Ask yourself why you're feeling resistant and what you can do to manage those feelings.\n2. Engage in activities you enjoy: Doing things you enjoy can help take your mind off of your resistant feelings and improve your mood.\n3. Talk to a trusted friend or family member: Sometimes talking to someone you trust can help you gain perspective and feel less alone in your feelings.\n4. Try relaxation techniques: Activities like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or yoga can help you manage stress and feel more relaxed.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel resistant sometimes, and it's important to be kind to yourself as you work through these feelings."}], "summarized_conversation": "A troubled student has been getting into trouble at school and at home.
