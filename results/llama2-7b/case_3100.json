Based on your symptoms, I would like to consider the possibility of a pulmonary embolism. This is a blood clot that forms in the lungs, which can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing up blood. It's important to rule out this possibility as it can be a medical emergency.\n\nI would like to order some additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis. An X-ray or CT scan of the chest can help us visualize the lungs and identify any clots.
