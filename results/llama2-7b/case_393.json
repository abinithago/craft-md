Based on your symptoms, I believe you may have developed a condition called patellofemoral pain syndrome. This is a common condition that affects the front of the knee, causing pain and discomfort.\n\nPatellofemoral pain syndrome occurs when the cartilage on the underside of the kneecap (patella) becomes irritated or inflamed, leading to pain in the front of the knee. This can be caused by overuse or repetitive motion, poor alignment of the knee, or weak quadriceps muscles.\n\nI recommend that you see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, you can try applying ice to the affected area to reduce swelling and pain, and taking over-the-counter pain medication as needed. You can also try to avoid activities that aggravate the condition and incorporate exercises that strengthen your quadriceps muscles.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with."}], "summarized_conversation": "The patient has been experiencing increasing pain and swelling in the right knee for the past 12 days.
