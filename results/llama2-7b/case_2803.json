The pain has not improved with any pain medications, and there is no specific description of the pain beyond it being bad when trying to rest on that side. The patient denies any weakness or numbness in their arm or hand, as well as any injuries or trauma to the shoulder. They have not tried physical therapy or exercises for the pain, and there is limited movement in the shoulder. The pain affects their sleep, especially when lying on the left side. Movement in the arm in any direction causes discomfort due to the limited movement and pain in the shoulder. The patient also reports that they haven't noticed any triggers or patterns that make the pain better, but lying on the left side makes it worse.
