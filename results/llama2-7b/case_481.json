Ultrasound of the legs: This non-invasive test uses sound waves to create images of the blood vessels in your legs, which can help identify any blockages or narrowing.\n2. Electrocardiogram (ECG): This test measures the electrical activity of your heart and can help identify any abnormal rhythms or signs of heart damage.\n3. Stress test: This test is used to evaluate how well your heart and blood vessels respond to physical activity. It may involve walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while your heart rate and blood pressure are monitored.\n4.
