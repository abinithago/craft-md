Based on what you've told me, I would like to suggest a few possible causes of your symptoms.\n\nOne possibility is that your high blood pressure and smoking history may be contributing to your shortness of breath and dizziness. High blood pressure can cause damage to the blood vessels in the lungs, leading to shortness of breath, and smoking can further damage these vessels and reduce the amount of oxygen that reaches the body's tissues.\n\nAnother possibility is that you may have developed coronary artery disease, which is the narrowing or blockage of the blood vessels that supply the heart.
