He says the other employees are busy doing their own work and have only formal conversations, yet she is convinced that they are talking about her. He further adds that his wife frequently believes that some advertisements in a newspaper are directed towards her and are published specifically to catch her attention even though they are routine advertisements. The patient denies any mood disturbances, anxiety or hallucinations. Past medical history is significant for a tingling sensation in her legs, 3+ patellar reflexes bilaterally, and absent ankle reflexes bilaterally.

On physical examination, the patient is conscious, alert, and oriented to time, place and person. A beefy red color of the tongue is noted. No associated cracking, bleeding, or oral lesions.
