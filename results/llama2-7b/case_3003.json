They may recommend a pelvic floor exercise program to help strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and urethra, or other treatments such as a pessary, which is a device that is inserted into the vagina to provide support to the bladder and urethra.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some simple exercises to help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.
