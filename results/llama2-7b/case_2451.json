Based on what you've told me, I would like to consider the possibility of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) as a possible cause of your balance issues.\n\nBPPV is a common inner ear disorder that can cause brief episodes of vertigo triggered by specific head movements. It is often brought on by sudden head movements, such as getting up too fast, or by changes in position.\n\nCan you tell me more about the movements that make your balance worse?

Based on your symptoms, it is likely that you have BPPV. BPPV is caused by small crystals in the inner ear becoming dislodged and moving into the canals of the inner ear, causing a person to feel dizzy or vertiginous with certain head movements.\n\nI recommend that you see a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment. They may perform a series of movements called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to help confirm the diagnosis of BPPV. Treatment for BPPV usually involves a series of exercises called canalith repositioning procedures (such as the Epley maneuver) to help move the crystals back into their proper position in the inner ear.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage your symptoms:\n\n* Avoid quick head movements, such as looking up or getting up too quickly.\n* Take your time when moving your head, and try to move slowly and smoothly.\n* Avoid bending or twisting, as these movements can also trigger BPPV."}], "summarized_conversation": "A 35-year-old individual presents with progressive hearing loss in the right ear and a persistent ringing sound.
