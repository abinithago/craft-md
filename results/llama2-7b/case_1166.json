Based on your symptoms, it is possible that you may have a herniated disc in your lower back that is causing the weakness and numbness in your left leg, as well as the sharp pain that shoots down to the back of your leg.\n\nA herniated disc occurs when the soft, gel-like center of a spinal disc bulges out through a tear in the outer, tougher layer. This can put pressure on the nearby nerves, causing pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected area.\n\nIt is important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing these types of symptoms, as herniated discs can cause permanent nerve damage if left untreated. A healthcare professional can perform a thorough examination and imaging tests, such as an MRI, to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some self-care measures to help manage your symptoms.
