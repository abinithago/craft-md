The fact that your voice has been hoarse for a few months and has not improved is also concerning, as it could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition.\n\nI would like to schedule you for a chest X-ray and a complete blood count (CBC) as soon as possible. These tests will help us to determine the cause of your symptoms and identify any potential complications.
