Based on your symptoms, I would like to perform some tests to confirm the diagnosis. I will need to perform a pelvic examination and order some imaging tests, such as an ultrasound or CT scan, to visualize the reproductive organs and determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nI would like to schedule you for a pelvic examination and imaging tests as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend that you avoid any strenuous activities and take it easy to avoid any further complications.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the diagnosis or treatment?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I understand, and I'll avoid strenuous activities.

Based on your symptoms and medical history, it's possible that you may have an ectopic pregnancy, which is a pregnancy that develops outside of the uterus. This can be a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention.\n\nThe imaging tests that I mentioned earlier will help us to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. In some cases, medication may be sufficient to treat the ectopic pregnancy. In other cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the pregnancy.\n\nI will be in touch with you soon to discuss the results of the tests and to go over the treatment options with you. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nThank you for being here today. **Final Diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy**"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents with pain in the lower right side of the stomach and light bleeding from the vagina.
