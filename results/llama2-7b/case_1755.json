{"case_id": "case_1755", "case_vignette": "A 56-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for dizziness. She says that her symptoms began approximately 1 month prior to presentation and are associated with nausea and ringing of the ears. She describes her dizziness as a spinning sensation that has a start and end and lasts approximately 25 minutes. This dizziness is severe enough that she cannot walk or stand. Her symptoms are fluctuating, and she denies any tunnel vision or feelings of fainting. However, she has abruptly fallen to the ground in the past and denied losing consciousness. Medical history is significant for a migraine with aura treated with zolmitriptan, type 2 diabetes managed with metformin, and hypertension managed with lisinopril. Her blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 16/min. On physical exam, when words are whispered into her right ear, she is unable to repeat the whispered words aloud; however, this is normal in the left ear. Air conduction is greater than bone conduction with Rinne testing, and the sound of the tuning fork is loudest in the left ear on Weber testing.

The nausea and hearing loss on the right side are common symptoms of BPPV.\n\nBPPV is caused by small crystals in the inner ear becoming dislodged and moving into the canals of the inner ear. This can cause a person to feel like they are spinning or moving, even when they are standing still. The nausea and hearing loss are caused by the movement of the crystals in the inner ear.\n\nThere are several treatments for BPPV, including the Epley maneuver, which is a series of movements that can help to move the crystals back into their proper position in the inner ear. I would recommend trying the Epley maneuver at home to see if it helps to alleviate your symptoms.\n\nHere are the steps of the Epley maneuver:\n\n1. Sit on a bed or chair with your affected side facing up.\n2. Slowly turn your head to the opposite side, so your ear is facing down.\n3. Hold this position for 30 seconds.\n4."}], "summarized_conversation": "A 37-year-old individual presents to the doctor's office with complaints of dizziness that feels like spinning and has been occurring for the past month.
