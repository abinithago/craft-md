Pulse oximetry on room air shows oxygen saturation at 98%. An S4 is audible over the precordium, in addition to crepitus over the chest. Abdominal examination shows tenderness to palpation in the epigastric area. Serum studies show an initial Troponin I level of 0.031 ng/mL (N < 0.1 ng/mL) and 0.026 ng/mL 6 hours later. A 12-lead ECG shows sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-T changes.
