A mammogram is a non-invasive imaging test that can help us visualize the breast tissue and detect any abnormalities, such as tumors or cysts. It's a good idea to start with this test because it can give us a clear image of the breast tissue and help us determine if further testing is needed.\n\nA mammogram involves placing your breast on a special X-ray machine, and X-rays are taken from different angles to create detailed images of the breast tissue. The test is quick and easy, and it's usually done in a doctor's office or imaging center.\n\nIf the mammogram shows any abnormalities, we may recommend additional testing, such as an ultrasound or biopsy, to further evaluate the area.

Can you tell me a little bit more about the lump? How long have you noticed it, and has it changed in size or shape over time?

I would like to schedule a follow-up mammogram for you in 2 weeks to see if the lump has changed in size or shape. If the lump is still present and has not changed, we may consider a biopsy to remove a small sample of the tissue for further examination.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to continue to monitor the lump and watch for any changes in size, shape, or symptoms.
