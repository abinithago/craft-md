Your history of smoking and exposure to air pollution in your workplace increase your risk of developing COPD.\n\nI would recommend a spirometry test to confirm the diagnosis of COPD and to assess the severity of the disease. The test measures the lung's ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide, and can help determine the degree of airflow obstruction in the lungs.\n\nIn addition to the spirometry test, I may also recommend other diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray or CT scan to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms.\n\nBased on the diagnosis, we can discuss treatment"}], "summarized_conversation": "A 56-year-old man presents to the clinic with worsening shortness of breath over the past year and weight loss.
