Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have a condition called dysphagia, which is difficulty swallowing. Dysphagia can occur due to a variety of reasons, including neurological disorders, structural problems in the throat, or certain medications.\n\nHere are some possible causes of dysphagia that you may want to discuss with your doctor:\n\n1. Neurological disorders: Dysphagia can be caused by neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, or brain tumors.\n2. Structural problems: Dysphagia can occur due to structural problems in the throat, such as a narrow esophagus or a tumor in the throat.\n3. Medications: Certain medications, such as anticholinergic drugs, can cause dry mouth and difficulty swallowing.\n4. Aging: Dysphagia is a common condition in older adults, particularly those with dementia or Alzheimer's disease."}], "summarized_conversation": "A 45-year-old individual has been experiencing progressive muscle weakness for five months, particularly in the shoulders and hips.
