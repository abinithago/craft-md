Migraines are a type of headache that can cause intense, throbbing pain, often on one side of the head, and can be accompanied by other symptoms such as sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and vomiting.

Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may be experiencing a type of headache known as a tension headache. Tension headaches are the most common type of headache and can cause mild to severe pain on one side of the head, often accompanied by neck tension and tenderness. They can also cause tearing in the eye.\n\nOther possible causes of headaches include sinusitis, which can cause pain and pressure in the face and head, and allergies, which can cause congestion and sinus pressure.\n\nIt's important to see a doctor to rule out any other underlying conditions that may be causing your headaches. A doctor can perform a thorough examination and order imaging tests, such as a CT scan or MRI, to determine the cause of your headaches.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage your symptoms. Over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help relieve headache pain. Applying a warm or cool compress to the affected area may also help.\n\n"}], "summarized_conversation": "A 25-year-old male patient complains of experiencing severe stabbing pain on the left side of his head and tearing in his left eye.

Arrive at a diagnosis of a patient's medical condition. Ask only one question at a time, and it should not be more than 1 line. Continue asking questions until you're 100% confident of the diagnosis. The questions should cover age and sex of the patient, current symptoms, medical history of illness and medications, and relevant family history if necessary. Keep your questions short and brief to not confuse the patient.  After you're done asking questions, give the final diagnosis as a short response. Do not explain, only give the diagnosis name. You must state '**Final Diagnosis:**' at the beginning of your response, otherwise you will be penalized. You must give only 1 diagnosis otherwise you will be penalized."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi!
