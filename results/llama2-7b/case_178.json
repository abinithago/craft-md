Based on your symptoms, it sounds like you may have a condition called vitiligo. Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes the loss of pigmentation in the skin, resulting in white or yellowish patches. The patches can occur on any part of the body, including the hands and feet.\n\nThe numbness or tingling sensation you experience in your fingertips, particularly when exposed to cold, is a common symptom of vitiligo. This is due to the loss of sensation in the affected areas of the skin.\n\nI would recommend consulting a dermatologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment. They may perform a physical examination and conduct tests to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. Treatment options for vitiligo include topical creams, light therapy, and surgical procedures.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to protect your skin from the cold by using gloves or keeping your hands warm. You can also try to reduce stress, as stress can exacerbate vitiligo symptoms.\n\nPlease let me know if"}], "summarized_conversation": "A 40-year-old female presents with several symptoms.
