Based on the information provided, I would like to ask some additional questions to help determine the cause of the vaginal fullness or heaviness:\n\n1. Have you noticed any changes in your vaginal lubrication?\n2. Have you experienced any vaginal itching or burning?\n3. Have you had any recent changes in your sexual activity or partners?\n4. Have you noticed any changes in your overall health, such as fatigue or mood changes?\n\nPlease answer these questions to help me narrow down the possible causes of your vaginal fullness or heaviness."}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents with a sensation of fullness in the vaginal area, along with lower back and pelvic pain that worsens with prolonged standing or walking.
