Viral gastroenteritis: This is a common cause of bloody stool in babies, especially during the winter months. It's caused by a viral infection that inflames the stomach and intestines, leading to diarrhea and sometimes blood in the stool.\n2. Food intolerance: Some babies may have a reaction to certain foods, such as lactose or gluten, which can cause bloody stool. If you're breastfeeding, you may want to try eliminating dairy products from your diet for a few days to see if this helps.\n3.
