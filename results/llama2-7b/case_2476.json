Based on what you've told me, I would like to consider a few possible causes for your symptoms.\n\nOne possibility is that your recent upper respiratory infection may have caused a condition called peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves in your body, particularly in your hands and feet. This can cause numbness, tingling, and weakness in the affected areas.\n\nAnother possibility is that you may have developed a condition called myasthenia gravis, which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerve-muscle connection. This can cause weakness and fatigue in the muscles, including those in the face and arms.\n\nI would like to refer you to a specialist for further evaluation and diagnosis.
