However, your recent weight loss efforts and stress from trying to lose weight could be contributing to your palpitations and chest pain.\n2. **Angina:** Your symptoms could also be related to angina, which is chest pain that occurs when the heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen. If you have a history of coronary artery disease or risk factors for it, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol, this could be a possibility.\n3. **Hyperthyroidism:** As you've mentioned that you've been trying to lose weight, it's possible that your symptoms could be related to an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism).
