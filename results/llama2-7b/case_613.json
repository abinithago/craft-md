Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): The previous episode of belly pain and fever, along with the ongoing rectal bleeding, could be indicative of IBD, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.\n2. Diverticulitis: The bleeding could be related to diverticulitis, which is inflammation of the diverticula (small pouches that form in the wall of the colon).\n3. Infection: The rectal bleeding could be caused by an infection, such as a bacterial or viral infection, that has spread to the colon.\n4.
