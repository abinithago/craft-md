These injections are usually given every 3-4 months to maintain the effect.\n2. Endoscopic balloon dilation: This is a minimally invasive procedure in which a balloon is inserted through an endoscope and inflated to stretch the narrowed area of the esophagus. This can help improve swallowing and reduce symptoms.\n3. Surgery: Surgery may be recommended for achalasia that is severe or does not respond to other treatments. The most common surgical procedure for achalasia is laparoscopic Heller myotomy, which involves cutting the muscles in the lower esophagus to improve swallowing.\n4.
