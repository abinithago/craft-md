Sinus headaches: These are caused by inflammation or infection in the sinuses, which are air-filled cavities in the skull.\n4. Cluster headaches: These are severe headaches that occur in clusters or cycles, often accompanied by tearing and redness of the eye on the same side as the headache.\n\nIt's important to see a doctor to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
