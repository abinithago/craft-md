It can also cause a feeling of walking on a \"cloud\" or \"drunk\"-like sensation, which you mentioned.\n\nI recommend that you speak with your doctor about your symptoms and ask for a referral to a neurologist. The neurologist can perform a thorough examination and order additional tests to determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to avoid any activities that may exacerbate your symptoms and to take steps to manage your condition. This may include physical therapy, pain management, and other treatments as recommended by your healthcare provider.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\n\nFinal diagnosis: Natalizumab-induced peripheral neuropathy."}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient has noticed difficulty walking lately, with some friends noting that they seem to be walking like they're drunk.

It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including unsteadiness, weakness, and tingling or numbness in the arms and legs.\n\nMS is caused by an abnormal response of the immune system, which leads to inflammation and damage to the protective covering of nerve fibers. This damage disrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body, leading to a wide range of symptoms.\n\nWhile MS can be difficult to diagnose, there are several tests that can help confirm the diagnosis.
