Based on what you've told me, there are several potential causes for your persistent joint pain and discomfort when urinating. Here are some possible explanations:\n\n1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): A UTI can cause discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen, groin, and even the joints. It can also cause a burning sensation during urination. If you haven't already, I recommend that you visit a healthcare provider for a urinalysis and a culture to confirm or rule out a UTI.\n2. Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS): IC/BPS is a chronic condition that causes pain or discomfort in the bladder and surrounding areas, including the joints. The exact cause of IC/BPS is unknown, but it may be related to inflammation or irritation of the bladder wall. Treatment options for IC/BPS include medications, bladder instillation therapy, and lifestyle changes.\n3.
