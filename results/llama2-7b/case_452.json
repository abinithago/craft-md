It can cause yellowing of the skin and eyes, and is usually not a cause for concern.

Breastfeeding-related jaundice: Breastfeeding can cause a temporary increase in bilirubin levels, which can lead to yellowing of the skin and eyes. This is more common in breastfed babies than formula-fed babies. In most cases, the bilirubin levels will return to normal on their own within a few days to a week.\n3.
