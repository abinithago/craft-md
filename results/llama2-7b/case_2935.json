Based on your symptoms and physical examination, I would like to consider the possibility of patellar subluxation. Patellar subluxation is a condition where the kneecap shifts out of its normal position in the knee joint, which can cause knee pain and looseness in the knee.\n\nCan you tell me, have you noticed any improvement in your knee pain after stopping or reducing your running?

The patient denies any significant knee trauma. The examination didn't mention any swelling or redness. There is increased looseness when the kneecap is moved from side to side. The patient denies noticing any clicking or snapping sensations in their knee. The pain started after they began training for a marathon, which was a change in their exercise routine. The pain has been gradual and has slowly worsened since it started two months ago, but the patient hasn't provided a specific rating for the severity.
