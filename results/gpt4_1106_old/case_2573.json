She has a family history of maternal hypertension. Her vital signs include heart rate 106/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. On physical examination, thoracic expansion was diminished on the right side with rhonchi and crackles on the lower two-thirds of both sides, with left predominance. A systolic murmur was heard on the tricuspid foci, which increased in intensity with inspiration. There was jugular engorgement when the bed was placed at 50\u00b0. Palpation of the abdomen was painful on the right hypochondrium, with hepatomegaly 4 cm below the lower coastal edge. Hepatojugular reflux was present. Soft, painless, pitting edema was present in both lower limbs up until the middle third of both legs. Lung computed tomography (CT) and transthoracic echocardiogram were performed and detected right heart failure and severe pulmonary fibrosis.
