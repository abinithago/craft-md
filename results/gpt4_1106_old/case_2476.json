Her symptoms began with a burning sensation in her toes along with numbness. She claims that the weakness has been getting worse over the last few days and now involving her arms and face. Currently, she is unable to get up from the chair without some assistance. Her temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 145/89 mm Hg, the heart rate is 99/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. On physical examination, she has diminished breath sounds on auscultation of bilateral lung fields with noticeably poor inspiratory effort. Palpation of the lower abdomen reveals a palpable bladder. Strength is 3 out of 5 symmetrically in the lower extremities bilaterally. The sensation is intact.
