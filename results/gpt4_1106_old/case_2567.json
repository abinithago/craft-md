Occasionally he refers to himself in the third person. He refuses to eat anything and will only drink clear fluids because he is afraid of being poisoned. A medical records search reveals that the patient has been treated for psychotic behavior and occasional bouts of severe depression for several years. Today, his heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 19/min, blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical exam, he appears gaunt and anxious. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative.
