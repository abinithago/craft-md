The patient\u2019s roommate says that the patient has been looking for cameras that aliens planted in their apartment for the past 2 weeks. Approximately 3 months prior to the onset of this episode, the roommate says the patient stopped playing basketball daily because the sport no longer interested him. He stayed in his bedroom most of the day and was often tearful. The roommate recalls the patient talking about death frequently. The patient states he has been skipping many meals and has lost a significant amount of weight as a result. At the time his delusions about the aliens began, the depressive-related symptoms were no longer present. He has no other medical conditions.
