The pain is substernal, crushing in nature, radiating into her neck, and accompanied by profuse sweating. Her history is significant for hypertension, and she admits poor compliance with her medications. An ECG done at the clinic confirmed the presence of STEMI, and the patient was given aspirin. The ambulance was in an accident on the way to the hospital and by the time the patient reached the angiography suite, the cardiologist decided intervention should be delayed due to the late presentation. Also, the patient\u2019s pain has improved. The patient is admitted and is stable for 3 nights with no dyspnea or edema. Her blood pressure is kept under control while in the hospital. On the fourth night, the patient becomes quite agitated and soon thereafter she is unresponsive. Her pulse cannot be palpated. She has an elevated JVP and upon auscultation, heart sounds are distant.
