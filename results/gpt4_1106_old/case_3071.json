Inspection suggests a barrel chest and auscultation reveals the presence of bilateral end-expiratory wheezing and scattered rhonchi. He undergoes a detailed diagnostic evaluation which includes a complete blood count, chest radiogram, arterial blood gas analysis, and pulmonary function tests, all of which confirm a diagnosis of chronic obstructive lung disease.
