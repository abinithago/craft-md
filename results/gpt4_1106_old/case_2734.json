She says she has always been \"large\" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so. Her main concern at the moment is her acne and unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, for which she often visits a local spa. She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose. She has a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a menstrual cycle that occurs every 45 days. Her pulse is 72/min and the blood pressure is 138/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, her height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) and her weight is 85 kg (187 lb), and she has severe inflammatory acne over the cheeks and forehead and dark coarse hairs on the back.
