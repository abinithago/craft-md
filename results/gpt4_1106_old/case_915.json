{"case_id": "case_915", "case_vignette": "A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of worsening upper abdominal pain that he first noticed this morning after waking up. The pain is of tearing and burning quality and radiates to his back. Yesterday, he underwent an upper endoscopy and was diagnosed with gastritis and a large hiatal hernia. He has hypertension, hypercholesteremia, and a left bundle branch block that was diagnosed 5 years ago. The patient's mother died of myocardial infarction at the age of 70 years, and his father died of aortic dissection at the age of 65 years. The patient smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years, but quit 10 years ago. He drinks three beers daily. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, atorvastatin, and pantoprazole. The patient appears to be in mild distress. His temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 103/min, and blood pressure is 135/89 mm Hg in the left arm and 132/90 mm Hg in the right arm. Cardiopulmonary examination shows crackling with every heartbeat. Abdominal examination shows tenderness to palpation in the epigastric region; bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 16.0 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 11,000/mm3\nNa+ 140 mEq/L\nK+ 4.2 mEq/L\nCl- 101 mEq/L\nHCO3- 25 mEq/L\nCreatinine 1.3 mg/dL\nAlanine aminotransferase 21 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase 43 U/L\nLipase 40 U/L (N = 14\u2013280)\nTroponin I 0.025 ng/mL (N < 0.1)\nChest x-ray shows a large hiatal hernia and mediastinal lucency. A 12-lead EKG shows sinus tachycardia and a left bundle branch block.
