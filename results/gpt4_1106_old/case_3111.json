{"case_id": "case_3111", "case_vignette": "A 25-year-old woman is brought to a psychiatrist\u2019s office by her husband who states that he is worried about her recent behavior, as it has become more violent. The patient\u2019s husband states that his family drove across the country to visit them and that his wife \u2018threatened his parents with a knife\u2019 at dinner last night. Police had to be called to calm her down. He states that she has been acting \u2018really crazy\u2019 for the last 9 months, and the initial behavior that caused him alarm was her admission that his deceased sister was talking to her through a decorative piece of ceramic art in the living room. Initially, he thought she was joking, but soon realized her complaints of \u2018hearing ghosts\u2019 talking to her throughout the house were persisting and \u2018getting worse\u2019. There was also a 4-week period where she experienced insomnia and an unintentional weight loss of 12 pounds. She seemed sad throughout these episodes, and, according to her husband, was complaining of feeling \u2018worthless\u2019. Her general hygiene has also suffered from her recent lack of motivation and she insists that the \u2018ghosts\u2019 are asking her to kill as many people as she can so they won\u2019t be alone in the house. Her husband is extremely concerned that she may harm herself or someone else. He states that she currently does not take any medications or illicit drugs as far as he knows. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. The patient herself does not make eye contact or want to speak to the psychiatrist, allowing her husband to speak on her behalf.
