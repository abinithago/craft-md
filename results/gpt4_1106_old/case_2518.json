The girl states the rash started as a small red bump but has gradually progressed to its current size. No similar lesions were observed elsewhere by her or her mother. She has felt ill and her mother has detected intermittent low-grade fevers. During the skin examination, a target-like erythematous patch, approximately 7 cm in diameter, was noted on the left shoulder (as shown in the image). Another notable finding was axillary lymphadenopathy. On further questioning it was revealed that the patient went camping with her grandfather approximately 11 days ago; however, she does not recall any insect bites or exposure to animals.
