{"case_id": "case_2313", "case_vignette": "A 67-year-old woman presents to a surgeon with a painless, slowly growing ulcer in the periauricular region for the last 2 months. On physical examination, there is an irregular-shaped ulcer, 2 cm x 1 cm in its dimensions, with irregular margins and crusting over the surface. The woman is a fair-skinned individual who loves to go sunbathing. There is no family history of malignancy. After a complete physical examination, the surgeon performs a biopsy of the lesion under local anesthesia and sends the tissue for histopathological examination. The pathologist confirms the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. When she asks about the cause, the surgeon explains that there are many possible causes, but it is likely that she has developed squamous cell carcinoma on her face due to repeated exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun, especially ultraviolet B (UVB) rays.
