She says that she has been working as a personal assistant to a manager at a corporate business company for the last 2 years. Upon asking why she is not able to concentrate, she answers that her colleagues are always gossiping about her during work hours and that it disrupts her concentration severely. Her husband works in the same company and denies these allegations. He says the other employees are busy doing their own work and have only formal conversations, yet she is convinced that they are talking about her. He further adds that his wife frequently believes that some advertisements in a newspaper are directed towards her and are published specifically to catch her attention even though they are routine advertisements. The patient denies any mood disturbances, anxiety or hallucinations. Past medical history is significant for a tingling sensation in her legs, 3+ patellar reflexes bilaterally, and absent ankle reflexes bilaterally. She says that she drinks alcohol once to twice a month for social reasons but denies any other substance use or smoking. On physical examination, the patient is conscious, alert, and oriented to time, place and person. A beefy red color of the tongue is noted. No associated cracking, bleeding, or oral lesions.
