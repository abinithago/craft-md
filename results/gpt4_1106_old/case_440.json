{"case_id": "case_440", "case_vignette": "A 65-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of persistent pain in her right shoulder. The pain is localized to the top of the shoulder and is worse with movement. She has stiffness in the right shoulder that is worse in the morning and usually lasts 20 minutes. The patient reports that she is unable to brush her hair and has stopped going to her regular tennis lessons because of the pain. She does not recall any fall or trauma. When her right arm is passively abducted in an arc, there is pain between 60 and 120 degrees of abduction. When asked to lower the right arm slowly from 90 degrees of abduction, she is unable to hold her arm up and it drops to her side. Passive range of motion is normal. Injection of 5 mL of 1% lidocaine into the right subacromial space does not relieve the pain or improve active range of motion of the right arm.
