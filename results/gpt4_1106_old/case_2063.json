However, two months ago she noticed a sharp decline in his cognitive functioning as well as his gait. Then one month ago, she noticed a similar decline in his functioning again that came on suddenly. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. His blood pressure is 165/95 mmHg, pulse is 82/minute, he is afebrile, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Cardiac exam reveals a crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard in the left upper sternal border that radiates to the carotids. Abdominal exam is benign, and neurologic exam reveals an unsteady gait.
