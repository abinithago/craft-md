{"case_id": "case_390", "case_vignette": "A previously healthy 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of nervousness and difficulty sleeping over the past 4 weeks. She has difficulty falling asleep at night because she cannot stop worrying about her relationship and her future. Three months ago, her new boyfriend moved in with her. Before this relationship, she had been single for 13 years. She reports that her boyfriend does not keep things in order in the way she was used to. Sometimes, he puts his dirty dishes in the kitchen sink instead of putting them in the dishwasher directly. He refuses to add any groceries to the shopping list when they are used up. He has also suggested several times that they have dinner at a restaurant instead of eating at home, which enrages her because she likes to plan each dinner of the week and buy the required groceries beforehand. The patient says that she really loves her boyfriend but that she will never be able to tolerate his \u201cflaws.\u201d Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is cooperative but appears distressed. Her affect has little intensity or range.
