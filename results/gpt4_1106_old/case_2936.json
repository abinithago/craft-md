The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. The parents state that he has always been a solitary child without many friends, but that recently, he has been having behavioral problems that seem to be unprovoked and are occurring more frequently. The child will throw a tantrum for no reason and does not respond to punishment or reward. He also has a 'strange obsession' with collecting rocks that he finds on his way to and from school, so much so that his room is filled with rocks. His teachers say he \u201cdaydreams a lot\u201d and is very good at art, being able to recreate his favorite cartoon characters in great detail. On assessment, the patient does not make eye contact with the physician but talks incessantly about his rock collection.
