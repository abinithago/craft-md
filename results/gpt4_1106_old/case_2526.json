The patient was born on time and delivered via spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications. Family history is significant for a maternal aunt who died as an infant of unknown causes. The patient is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, he is awake, calm, and looks healthy, except for the yellow tone of the skin and scleral icterus. Laboratory findings are significant for elevated unconjugated bilirubin, with a normal complete blood count. Other routine laboratory blood tests are within normal limits. The patient is treated with phototherapy, but his jaundice worsens and his unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia persists well into the second week of life.
