One week ago, she was diagnosed with acute sinusitis and was started on amoxicillin. She has no history of adverse drug reactions and immunizations are up-to-date. Her temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows periorbital edema and multiple erythematous, annular plaques of variable sizes over her entire body. One of the lesions in the right popliteal fossa has an area of central clearing and the patient's mother reports that it has been present for over 24 hours. Urinalysis is normal.
