The patient claims the pain is severe and is stopping him from skateboarding. The patient recently recovered from a upper respiratory infection that he caught from his siblings but has otherwise been healthy. The patient has a past medical history of obesity. His temperature is 98.1\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, you note an obese boy in no acute distress. Cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. Inspection of the hip reveals no abnormalities or swelling. The hip exhibits a normal range of motion and physical exam only elicits minor pain. The patient's gait appears normal and pain is elicited when the patient jumps or runs.
