Examination of the forearm shows a 6 cm long, 0.5 cm deep wound with neat edges on the dorsal surface of the left forearm. There are bruises on the left shoulder, back, and the proximal phalanges of the right hand. On mental status examination, the patient is alert and calm. His mood is described as cheerful.
