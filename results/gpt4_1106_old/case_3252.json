He says that, 2 days ago, his divorce was finalized, so he went to a bar and had multiple shots of tequila and vodka.

A review of systems is significant for erectile dysfunction and chronic fatigue. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), the heart rate is 90/min, the blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 20/min. Physical examination shows scleral icterus. Mucous membranes are pale. Cardiac auscultation reveals a systolic flow murmur loudest along the left sternal border. There is moderate right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness with no rebound or guarding. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable.
