{"case_id": "case_2821", "case_vignette": "A 25-year-old primigravida woman at 35 weeks estimated gestational age presents with a headache for the past 5 hours.

In the emergency department, her blood pressure is found to be 150/100 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, respiratory rate is 30/min, and temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). Her records show that her blood pressure was the same yesterday during her regular antenatal visit. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral crackles along the lung base. Abdominal examination reveals a gravid uterus consistent with a gestational age of 32 weeks and a floating fetus in a cephalic presentation. Pelvic examination is performed which shows a closed firm cervix with no evidence of bleeding or discharge. Moderate pitting edema is noted and neurologic examination shows generalized hyperreflexia.
