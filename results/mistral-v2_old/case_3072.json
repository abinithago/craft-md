{"case_id": "case_3072", "case_vignette": "A 32-year-old Caucasian man presents to the physician because of the swelling and discomfort of the right testis for 3 weeks. There is no history of trauma, fever, or night sweats. He had surgery for an undescended right testis when he was 6 months old. There is no history of liver disease or hypogonadism. He has fathered 2 children. He takes no medications and denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs are within normal limits. Palpation of the scrotum reveals a firm nontender mass that cannot be separated from the right testis. Examination of the left testis shows no abnormalities. There is no supraclavicular or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Gynecomastia is present. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. Ultrasound shows an enlarged right testicle with a hypoechoic mass replacing a large portion of the normal architecture. The left testis is normal.
