{"case_id": "case_561", "case_vignette": "A 61-year-old man comes to the physician because of fatigue, diarrhea, and crampy abdominal pain for 3 weeks. The abdominal pain is worse after eating. During the past week, he has had up to 4 watery stools daily. He has also had pain in his mouth and gums for 6 days. He has not had nausea, vomiting, or fever. Four months ago, he went on a 1-week trip to the Dominican Republic. He has atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. Current medications include levothyroxine, metoprolol, and warfarin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 81/min, and blood pressure is 120/75 mm Hg. Examination shows two 1-cm, tender ulcerative lesions in the mouth. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. His hemoglobin concentration is 11.5 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume is 77 fL, leukocyte count is 11,800 mm3, and platelet count is 360,000 mm3. Colonoscopy with biopsy of the colonic mucosa is performed. Analysis of the specimen shows non-caseating granulomas and neutrophilic inflammation of the crypts.
