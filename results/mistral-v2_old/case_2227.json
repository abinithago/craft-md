Several minutes later, he became responsive but seemed confused. The patient has a past medical history of drug abuse and homelessness and is not currently taking any medications.

Physical exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with 5/5 strength in the upper and lower extremities and a stable gait.
