Ultimately, the patient is discharged with follow up instructions after no significant fractures or injuries are found. The patient then presents 4 months later to his primary doctor with weakness. The patient's strength in his upper extremities is 1/5. He has reduced sensation in his upper extremities as well. The patient's lower extremities reveal 5/5 strength with intact sensation.
