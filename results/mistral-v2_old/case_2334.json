The patient\u2019s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a disheveled male who is oriented to person, but not time or place. Neurologic examination shows nystagmus and severe gait ataxia. A T1/T2 MRI is performed and demonstrates evidence of damage to the mammillary bodies. The patient is given the appropriate treatment for recovering most of his cognitive functions. However, significant short-term memory deficits persist.
