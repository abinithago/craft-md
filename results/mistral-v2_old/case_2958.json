{"case_id": "case_2958", "case_vignette": "A 47-year-old taxi driver visits an ophthalmologist after failing a routine eye test for his driver\u2019s license renewal. The patient reports a slight blurring of his vision, headaches, and occasional dizziness for the past month. On further questioning, he admits to feeling tired and out of sorts most of the time. He attributes it to working overtime and experiencing stress at home. He also complains of decreased libido, decreased appetite, and some weight loss over the past 2 months. There is no history of cold intolerance or hoarseness of voice. On examination, the patient appears malnourished. His vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, his thyroid gland is firm and normal in size. Genital examination reveals small, soft testes with patchy pubic hair. Ophthalmic examination reveals decreased visual acuity. The visual field of the patient is shown in the image (black indicates loss of vision while white indicates full vision). His laboratory results are significant for decreased serum ACTH, decreased serum cortisol, normal serum TSH, normal serum T4, decreased serum LH, decreased serum FSH, and decreased serum GH. On suspicions raised by the patient\u2019s physical examination and lab studies, the clinician orders a brain MRI. The scan shows a pituitary macroadenoma impinging on and displacing the optic chiasm.
