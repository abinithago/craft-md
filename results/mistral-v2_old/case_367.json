Currently, he has no shortness of breath and has no anginal symptoms. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking but stopped smoking 10 years ago and does not drink alcohol. His pulse is 59/min, and his blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals 1+ lower extremity edema. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation show no abnormalities. There is no lymphadenopathy. His laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of 13.2 g/dL and serum protein of 10.1 g/dL. ECG shows known Q wave abnormalities unchanged since the last ECG one year ago. A serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation is shown.
