The symptoms described are consistent with edema due to renal causes, but none of the listed options perfectly fit. However, the symptoms are most suggestive of Nephrotic Syndrome, which includes edema, proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia. Since the patient did not report proteinuria, this diagnosis is less likely. The symptoms described are more consistent with peripheral edema, which can be caused by various conditions, including kidney disease. However, the absence of other symptoms, such as hematuria or significant proteinuria, makes other causes more likely. Based on the provided symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is Deep Vein Thrombosis or Lymphedema, which can cause peripheral edema.\n\nTherefore, the final diagnosis is: Deep Vein Thrombosis or Lymphedema.", "multiturn_frq": "**Final Diagnosis:** Edema (likely due to heart or kidney disease, further evaluation needed)", "singleturn_mcq": "Final Diagnosis: Edema with prolonged pitting suggests Renal disease.
