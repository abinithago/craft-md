{"case_id": "case_1755", "case_vignette": "A 56-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for dizziness. She says that her symptoms began approximately 1 month prior to presentation and are associated with nausea and ringing of the ears. She describes her dizziness as a spinning sensation that has a start and end and lasts approximately 25 minutes. This dizziness is severe enough that she cannot walk or stand. Her symptoms are fluctuating, and she denies any tunnel vision or feelings of fainting. However, she has abruptly fallen to the ground in the past and denied losing consciousness. Medical history is significant for a migraine with aura treated with zolmitriptan, type 2 diabetes managed with metformin, and hypertension managed with lisinopril. Her blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 16/min. On physical exam, when words are whispered into her right ear, she is unable to repeat the whispered words aloud; however, this is normal in the left ear. Air conduction is greater than bone conduction with Rinne testing, and the sound of the tuning fork is loudest in the left ear on Weber testing.
