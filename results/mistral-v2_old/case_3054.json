{"case_id": "case_3054", "case_vignette": "A 43-year-old woman presents to the neurology clinic in significant pain. She reports a sharp, stabbing electric-like pain on the right side of her face. The pain started suddenly 2 weeks ago. The pain is so excruciating that she can no longer laugh, speak, or eat her meals as these activities cause episodes of pain. She had to miss work last week as a result. Her attacks last about 3 minutes and go away when she goes to sleep. She typically has 2\u20133 attacks per day now. The vital signs include: blood pressure 132/84 mm Hg, heart rate 79/min, and respiratory rate 14/min. A neurological examination shows no loss of crude touch, tactile touch, or pain sensations on the left side of the face. The pupillary light and accommodation reflexes are normal. There is no drooping of her mouth, ptosis, or anhidrosis noted.
