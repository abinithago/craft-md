{"case_id": "case_3059", "case_vignette": "A 61-year-old man presents to the urgent care clinic complaining of cough and unintentional weight loss over the past 3 months. He works as a computer engineer, and he informs you that he has been having to meet several deadlines recently and has been under significant stress. His medical history is significant for gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and pulmonary histoplasmosis 10 years ago. He currently smokes 2 packs of cigarettes/day, drinks a 6-pack of beer/day, and he endorses a past history of cocaine use back in the early 2000s but currently denies any drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 18/min. His physical examination shows minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur, and a benign abdominal physical examination. However, on routine lab testing, you notice that his sodium is 127 mEq/L. His chest X-ray is shown in the picture.
