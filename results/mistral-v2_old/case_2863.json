She says that she isn\u2019t hearing high frequency sounds like she used to, especially in large rooms. Her past medical history shows significant bilateral lens dislocations 6 months ago. Family history reveals that her mother had chronic hematuria and her grandfather suffered from corneal dystrophy and died from renal failure at age 51. The vital signs include: blood pressure 145/95 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, and respiratory rate 19/min. On physical examination, the patient has mild to moderate bilateral sensorineural high-frequency hearing loss. A slit-lamp examination is shown in the exhibit (see image).
