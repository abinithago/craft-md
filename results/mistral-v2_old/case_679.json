Ten years ago, he was involved in a motor vehicle collision. Examination shows atrophy of the tongue. Muscle strength is decreased in the right upper and lower extremities. There is muscle stiffness in the left lower extremity. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the right upper and lower extremities, 3+ in the left upper extremity, and 4+ in the left lower extremity. Plantar reflex shows an extensor response on the left foot. Sensation to light touch, pinprick, and vibration is intact.
