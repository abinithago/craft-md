She was treated for pelvic inflammatory disease at the age of 20 years with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses condoms inconsistently. Her pulse is 118/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 118/66 mm Hg. Examination shows lower abdominal tenderness. Pelvic examination shows a closed cervix and a uterus of normal size with right adnexal tenderness. Her serum \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin concentration is 16,000 mIU/mL (N < 5). Transvaginal ultrasonography shows a 5-cm hypoechoic lesion at the junction of the fallopian tube and uterine cavity with a 3-mm layer of myometrium surrounding it.
