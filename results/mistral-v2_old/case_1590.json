For the last 3 months, he often has a blank stare for several minutes. He also claims to have seen strangers in the house on several occasions who were not present. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and was diagnosed with Parkinson disease 8 months ago. His current medications include carbidopa-levodopa, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin. His blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. He has short-term memory deficits and appears confused and disheveled. Examination shows bilateral muscle rigidity and resting tremor in his upper extremities. He has a slow gait with short steps. Microscopic examination of the cortex of a patient with the same condition is shown.
