The patient also complains of fatigue, a chronic cough that worsens at night, and burning chest pain that occurs after he eats. He says that he has used over-the-counter antacids for \u201cyears\u201d with mild relief. He denies any change in diet, but says he has \u201cgone down a pant size or 2.\u201d The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes amlodipine and atorvastatin. He smoked 1 pack of cigarettes a day for 12 years while in the military but quit 35 years ago. He drinks 1-2 beers on the weekend while he is golfing with his friends. His diet consists mostly of pasta, pizza, and steak. The patient's temperature is 98\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 143/91 mmHg, and pulse is 80/min. His BMI is 32 kg/m^2. Physical examination reveals an obese man in no acute distress. No masses or enlarged lymph nodes are appreciated upon palpation of the neck. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. An endoscopy is performed, which identifies a lower esophageal mass.
