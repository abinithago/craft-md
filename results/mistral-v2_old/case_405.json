His current medications include daily tacrolimus, prednisone, valganciclovir, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.9\u00b0F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. He appears uncomfortable and has mild jaundice. Examination shows scleral icterus. The abdomen is soft and tender to deep palpation over the right upper quadrant, where there is a well-healed surgical scar. His leukocyte count is 2500/mm3, serum bilirubin concentration is 2.6 mg/dL, and serum tacrolimus concentration is within therapeutic range.
