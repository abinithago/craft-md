He has had night sweats for the past several months and has lost 5 kg (11 lb) unintentionally during this period. He has no history of severe illness and takes no medications. The vital signs are within normal limits. The examination shows no abnormalities other than splenomegaly. The laboratory studies show the following:\nHemoglobin 9 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 95 \u03bcm3\nLeukocyte count 12,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 260,000/mm3\nUltrasound shows a spleen size of 15 cm and mild hepatomegaly. A peripheral blood smear shows teardrop-shaped and nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) and immature myeloid cells. The marrow is very difficult to aspirate but reveals hyperplasia of all 3 lineages. The tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test is negative. Clonal marrow plasma cells are not seen. JAK-2 is positive.
