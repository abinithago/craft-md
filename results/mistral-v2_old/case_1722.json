They state that over the past several months she has started to act oddly, combing the hair of her toy dolls for hours without stopping and repetitively counting her steps in the house. She is often brought to tears when confronted about these behaviors. The patient has no past medical history. When questioned about family history, the mother states she has needed close medical follow-up in the past, but declines to elaborate. The patient's vital signs are all within normal limits. On physical exam the patient is a well nourished 11-year-old girl in no acute distress. She has occasional motor tics, but the remainder of the exam is benign.
