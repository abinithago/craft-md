He had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55 years and an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair at the age of 60 years. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His current medications include sitagliptin, metformin, atorvastatin, metoprolol succinate, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 150/87 mm Hg. Examination shows full muscle strength.
