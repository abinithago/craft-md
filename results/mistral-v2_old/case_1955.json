The patient was at a stop when he was rear-ended from behind by a vehicle traveling at 11 miles per hour. The patient complains of severe back pain but states he otherwise feels well. The patient is currently seeing a physical therapist who is giving him exercises to alleviate the back pain that is present every morning, relived by activity, and worse with inactivity. He is a student at the university and is struggling with his grades. His temperature is 98.4\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 117/78 mmHg, pulse is 116/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam demonstrates a decreased range of motion of the patient's spine and tenderness to palpation over the vertebrae. The rest of the exam is deferred due to pain. The patient is requesting a note to excuse him from final exams and work.
