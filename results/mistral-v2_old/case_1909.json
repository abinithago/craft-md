She admits to being an IV heroin user with her last use being yesterday evening. The patient has also been homeless for three years. She reports that she was sexually assaulted at a shelter, so she is afraid to go back. Instead, she buys her own meals, when she can, with donations. The patient is currently sexually active with two male partners. She has never had testing for sexually transmitted diseases. The patient reports blurry vision, but admits she has not been to an eye doctor for over five years. She denies fever, headache, palpitations, night sweats, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, or rashes. On exam, the patient appears emaciated. Neurologic examination shows a decreased vibratory sense and proprioception in the fingers and toes. Pupils are equally reactive to light and accommodation. The patient has mild difficulty rising from a chair without using her upper extremities to assist.
