He first noticed the bump after hitting his shin during a soccer game. The lesion later \u201copened up\u201d into an ulceration. The patient also complains of lower back pain and intermittent diarrhea for the past four months. The patient\u2019s medical history is non-significant except for chlamydia for which he was successfully treated. He uses acetaminophen for the back pain but takes no other medications. The patient is sexually active with two male partners. He smokes marijuana daily. He reports he recently returned from his summer volunteering at a children\u2019s soccer program in Uganda. While there he reports getting bit by mosquitos and took anti-malarial medication as prescribed. Physical examination shows limited spine flexion and a lesion as pictured in Figure A.
