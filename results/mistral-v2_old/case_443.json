Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Pulmonary examination shows decreased breath sounds over the right lower lung fields. CT scan of the chest shows fractures of the right 7th and 8th ribs, right pleural splitting and thickening, and a dense fluid collection in the pleural space.
