This morning he was complaining of worsened headache and was acting odd, prompting his wife to bring him to the hospital. His past medical history is unremarkable. At the hospital, his temperature is 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F), pulse is 116/min, and blood pressure is 96/64 mm Hg. Physical examination is notable for neck stiffness and a large scar across his abdomen that his wife says is from a splenectomy operation following a car accident a few years ago. He has not seen a doctor since that time. A lumbar puncture shows elevated protein, low glucose, and 1,200 WBCs with 95% polymorphonuclear cells; gram staining shows gram-positive diplococci.
