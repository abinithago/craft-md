She reports that he has been wearing her dresses at home and asks to be called Lilly. He also stopped going to swim class because he \u201cdoesn't feel comfortable in swim trunks.\u201d Since starting puberty about a year ago, he has not had any friends and the teachers report he is consistently being bullied at school. His academic performance has been poor for the last year even though he had maintained an A average the year before. The mother further reports that her son has had mainly female friends since preschool. She also mentions that as a child her son never enjoyed playing with typical boy toys like cars and instead preferred dressing up dolls. The patient was raised by his single mother from the age of 8 because his father left the family due to financial issues. He appears shy. Physical examination shows normal male external genitalia. There is scarce coarse, dark axillary and pubic hair. Upon questioning, the patient reports that he would rather be a girl.
