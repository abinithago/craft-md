{"case_id": "case_3613", "case_vignette": "A 17-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents who are concerned about his bizarre behavior. Over the past three months, he has become withdrawn from his friends and less interested in his classes and extracurricular activities. On several occasions, he has torn apart rooms in their home looking for \u201cbugs\u201d and states that the President is spying on him because aliens have told the government that he is a threat. Although he has always been quite clean in the past, his father notes that the patient\u2019s room is now malodorous with clothes and dishes strewn about haphazardly. He also says that sometimes he can hear the devil speaking to him from inside his head. He has no medical problems, does not drink alcohol or use any drugs. Physical examination of the boy reveals no abnormalities. On mental status examination, the boy is oriented to person, place and time. He avoids eye contact and replies mostly with monosyllabic responses. He appears distracted, and confirms that he is hearing whispering voices in his head.
