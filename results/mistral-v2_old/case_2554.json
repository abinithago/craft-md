{"case_id": "case_2554", "case_vignette": "A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain and uneasiness. He says that symptoms onset acutely half an hour ago while he was watching television. He describes the pain as being 8/10 in intensity, sharp in character, localized to the center of the chest and retrosternal, and radiating to the back and shoulders. The patient denies any associated change in the pain with breathing or body position. He says he has associated nausea but denies any vomiting. He denies any recent history of fever, chills, or chronic cough. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus for which he takes lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin, and metformin. He reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and has 1\u20132 alcoholic drinks during the weekend. Family history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and an ST elevation myocardial infarction in his father and paternal uncle. His blood pressure is 220/110 mm Hg in the right arm and 180/100 mm Hg in the left arm. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic. Cardiac exam reveals a grade 2/6 diastolic decrescendo murmur loudest over the left sternal border. Remainder of the physical examination is normal. The chest radiograph shows a widened mediastinum. The electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals non-specific ST segment and T wave changes. Intravenous morphine and beta-blockers are started.
