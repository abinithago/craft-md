The woman is a fair-skinned individual who loves to go sunbathing. There is no family history of malignancy. After a complete physical examination, the surgeon performs a biopsy of the lesion under local anesthesia and sends the tissue for histopathological examination. The pathologist confirms the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
