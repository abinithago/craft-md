{"case_id": "case_2803", "case_vignette": "A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining of left shoulder pain for several weeks. He says that the pain often worsens when he tries to sleep on his left side. Although he tried several pain medications, none of the pain medications helped. He is an amateur tennis player who practices on weekends. He denies any trauma during his practice sessions. On examination of the shoulder joint, severe tenderness was present localized to the greater tuberosity of the left shoulder joint along with biceps tendon tenderness over the bicipital groove. The range of motion was limited to the left side. An X-ray of the joint showed narrowing of the acromiohumeral space with sclerosis and spurring of the acromion. Routine blood test results are normal except for the rheumatoid factor, which is positive.
