{"case_id": "case_3021", "case_vignette": "A 28-year-old woman presents to an outpatient clinic for a routine gynecologic examination. She is concerned about some swelling on the right side of her vagina. She senses that the right side is larger than the left and complains that sometimes that area itches and there is a dull ache. She denies any recent travel or history of trauma. She mentions that she is sexually active in a monogamous relationship with her husband; they use condoms inconsistently. On physical examination her vital signs are normal. Examination of the pelvic area reveals a soft, non-tender, mobile mass that measures approximately 2 cm in the greatest dimension at the 8 o\u2019clock position on the right side of the vulva, just below the vaginal wall.
