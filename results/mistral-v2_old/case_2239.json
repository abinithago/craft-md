Initially, the patient was noted to be behaving inappropriately including using foul language and grabbing people unexpectedly. This has progressed to a worsening of his memory and trouble caring for himself. His temperature is 98.1\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 162/103 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly man who laughs inappropriately at times and who is a poor historian. When he is engaged in conversation, he exhibits word finding difficulty and is rather inattentive.
