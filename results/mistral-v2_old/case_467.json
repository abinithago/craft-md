Three days ago, she developed diffuse abdominal pain, malaise, nausea, and vomiting. She has a 2-year history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Four months ago, she spent 2 weeks in Belize for her honeymoon. Her previous pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia, which was terminated by induction of labor at 37 weeks' gestation. Her only medication is esomeprazole. She appears tired. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 118/79 mm Hg. She responds to sound and communicates in short sentences. Examination shows yellowish discoloration of the sclera and abdominal distention. There is tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant. When she is asked to hold her hands in extension, there is a notable flapping tremor. Her uterus is consistent in size with a 31-week gestation.
