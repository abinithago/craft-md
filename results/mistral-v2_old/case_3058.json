An hour later, upon admission, the patient only opened his eyes to painful stimuli, made incomprehensible sounds, and assumed a flexed posture. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 140/80 mm Hg; heart rate 59/min; respiratory rate 11/min; temperature 37.0\u2103 (99.1\u2109), and SaO2, 95% on room air. The examination shows a laceration and bruising on the left side of the head. There is anisocoria with the left pupil 3 mm more dilated than the right. Both pupils react sluggishly to light. There is an increase in tone and hyperreflexia in the right upper and lower extremities. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, head elevated to 30\u00b0, and sent for a CT scan.
