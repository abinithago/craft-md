{"case_id": "case_1693", "case_vignette": "A 27-year-old young man presents to his primary care physician for weakness and tingling in his hand. The patient is an avid bodybuilder and has noticed that his grip strength has gradually worsened in both hands with symptoms worse at the end of a long workout. The patient has a past medical history of anabolic steroid use in high school. His current medications include a multivitamin, fish oil, and whey protein supplements. On physical exam, you note a muscular young man with male pattern hair loss. The patient has a loss of sensation bilaterally over the volar surface of the 4th and 5th digits and over the medial aspect of the volar forearm. The patient has 3/5 grip strength of his left hand and 2/5 grip strength of his right hand. There is also notable weakness of finger adduction and abduction. The rest of the patient's physical exam is within normal limits.\n\n", "question": "Which  is the most likely diagnosis?", "correct_ans": "cubital tunnel compression", "trial_0": {"multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Neurology.
