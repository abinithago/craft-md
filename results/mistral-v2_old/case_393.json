He is sexually active with 2 female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He appears anxious. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 68/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. Examination shows bilateral inflammation of the conjunctiva. The right knee is tender, erythematous, and swollen; range of motion is limited by pain. There is tenderness at the left Achilles tendon insertion site. Genital examination shows no abnormalities.
