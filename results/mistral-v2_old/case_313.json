{"case_id": "case_313", "case_vignette": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe epigastric discomfort and left-sided chest pain radiating to the back that began after waking up. He has also vomited several times since the pain began. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy the previous day for evaluation of epigastric pain. He has ischemic heart disease and underwent a coronary angioplasty 3 years ago. His mother died of pancreatic cancer when she was 60 years old. His current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, ramipril, and rosuvastatin. He is pale, anxious, and diaphoretic. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg in his upper extremities and 108/68 mm Hg in his lower extremities. Pulse oximetry on room air shows oxygen saturation at 98%. An S4 is audible over the precordium, in addition to crepitus over the chest. Abdominal examination shows tenderness to palpation in the epigastric area. Serum studies show an initial Troponin I level of 0.031 ng/mL (N < 0.1 ng/mL) and 0.026 ng/mL 6 hours later. A 12-lead ECG shows sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-T changes.
