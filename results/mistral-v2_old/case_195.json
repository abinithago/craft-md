He was seen at urgent care a month ago and received one week course of cephalexin without any improvement. Local debridement attempts at bedside by the urgent care provider resulted in significant expansion of the ulcer. Physical examination reveals a well demarcated ovoid ulcer on the left distal shin with violaceous, rolled borders and cribriform base with yellow-red exudate.
