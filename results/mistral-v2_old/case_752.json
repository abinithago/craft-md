Thirty minutes ago, he was carrying heavy moving boxes from his house to a truck when he felt short of breath and suddenly lost consciousness. His wife states that he fell to the ground and was unresponsive for 15 seconds before he regained consciousness. He was not confused after this episode. He does not have chest pain. On questioning, he recalls experiencing episodic shortness of breath and chest tightness while playing tennis over the past year. These symptoms resolved with rest. He has no personal history of serious illness and takes no medication. Vital signs are within normal limits. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98\u00b0F), heart rate is 95/min and pulse is delayed but regular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 104/80 mm Hg.
