His past medical history is significant for sinusitis and allergic rhinitis since the age of 18, as well as episodic wheezing and shortness of breath since he was 30. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 22 years old, and subsequently with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) when he was 40. His current medications include albuterol, loratadine, mometasone, and omeprazole. His blood pressure is 128/86 mm Hg, heart rate is 78/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. On physical exam, the patient\u2019s skin is mottled and appears to have a diffuse, lace-like, erythematous discoloration of the arms, legs, and trunk. There is also a small papular rash on his right forearm. Bilateral wheezes are heard on auscultation.
