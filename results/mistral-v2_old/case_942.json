His wife says that he has begun to slur his words and has become very difficult to understand. His temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 16/min. His blood pressure is 130/80mm Hg while sitting and 110/65mm Hg when standing. He is oriented to person and place but not to time. Neurological examination shows a mild tremor in his right hand and rigidity in his upper and lower extremities. He is unable to perform repetitive rotary forearm movements.
