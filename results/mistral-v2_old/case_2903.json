{"case_id": "case_2903", "case_vignette": "A 35-year-old woman presents to her family doctor worried that she might have a heart condition. For the past 7 months, she has been having short panic attacks where she feels short of breath, sweaty, and feels like her heart wants to jump out her chest. During these attacks, she feels like she \u2018is going crazy\u2019. She has now mapped out all of the places she has had an attack such as the subway, the crowded pharmacy near her house, and an elevator at her work that is especially slow and poorly lit. She actively avoids these areas to prevent an additional episode. She is afraid that during these attacks she may not be able to get the help she needs or escape if needed. No significant past medical history. The patient takes no current medications. Her grandfather died of a heart attack at the age of 70 and she is worried that it might run in the family. The patient is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits. Laboratory results are unremarkable.
