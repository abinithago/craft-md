She denies any fevers, chills, abdominal pain, hematuria, dysuria, abnormal vaginal discharge, or increased urinary frequency. The patient had a bilateral tubal ligation 3 weeks ago. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. Her menses are regular and last 5 days. She has had 3 pregnancies that each resulted in uncomplicated, term vaginal deliveries. Her last pregnancy was 2 years ago. The patient has hypothyroidism and takes daily levothyroxine. She denies tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. She has no history of sexually transmitted diseases. She is sexually active with her husband of 25 years. Her BMI is 26 kg/m^2. On physical examination, the abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender without palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal tone is normal. The uterus is anteverted, mobile, and nontender. There are no adnexal masses. Urine is seen pooling in the vaginal vault. Urinalysis is unremarkable.
