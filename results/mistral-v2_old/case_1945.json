His right knee appears symmetric, but the patient whimpers when the anteromedial part of the tibial plateau is pressed. No other parts of his knee are tender. No tenderness is elicited with extension, flexion, varus, and valgus movements of the knee. McMurray's test is negative with both internal and external rotation of the right leg.
