The medication list includes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. He had a right inguinal hernia repair when he was a teenager. He smokes 20\u201330 cigarettes daily for the last 21 years, and drinks alcohol socially. His father died of a hemorrhagic stroke at the age of 69 years. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 131/88 mm Hg, and pulse 82/min. The physical examination is positive for a palpable right upper quadrant mass.
