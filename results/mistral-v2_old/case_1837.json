The patient has a 20 pack-year smoking history and was an alcoholic with her last drink 7 years ago. Her father died of colon cancer at the age of 62 and her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 45. She takes naproxen and ibuprofen for joint and back pain. Her temperature is 97.4\u00b0F (36.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/81 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly woman who has muscle wasting and a distended abdomen. Ultrasound is performed as seen in Figure A of the left lower quadrant of the abdomen.
