She has also had increasingly frequent episodes of urinary incontinence and now wears an adult diaper daily. She has hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Current medications include lisinopril and atorvastatin. Her temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 139/83 mmHg. She is confused and oriented only to person and place. She recalls 2 out of 3 words immediately and 1 out of 3 after five minutes. She has a broad-based gait and takes short steps. Sensation is intact and muscle strength is 5/5 throughout. Laboratory studies are within normal limits.
