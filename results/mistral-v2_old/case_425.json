While sprinting on the field, he slipped as he attempted to kick the ball and landed on the anterior aspect of his knee. He underwent an appendectomy at the age of 16 years. His vitals signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a swollen and tender left knee; range of motion is limited by pain. The tibial tuberosity shows tenderness to palpation. The left tibia is displaced posteriorly when force is applied to the proximal tibia after flexing the knee. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the left knee joint shows an avulsion fracture of the tibial condyle.
