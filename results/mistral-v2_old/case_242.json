She has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for the last 45 years. She drinks a glass of wine every day. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. She is oriented only to person. She recalls 2 out of 3 objects immediately and none after 5 minutes.
