The symptoms are worse in the morning and are associated with stiffness that lasts about 15 minutes. She also complains of profound fatigue and decreased appetite. She is sexually active with one partner in a monogamous relationship. Past medical history is unremarkable and she is taking oral contraceptives. She smokes 1\u20132 cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol socially on the weekends. Temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 12/min. Physical examination reveals wrists that are tender to palpation, warm, and mildly swollen. Several metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints on both hands are also tender. Hand and wrist strength is 5/5 bilaterally. A non-tender ulcer on the buccal mucosa is also noted. When asked about it, the patient reports that it has been there for several months and does not bother her.
