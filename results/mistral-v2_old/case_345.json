Next, he let out a loud scream, dropped to the floor unconscious, and began to jerk his arms and legs as well for about two minutes. On the way to the hospital, the boy regained consciousness, but was confused and could not speak clearly for about five minutes. He had a fever and sore throat one week ago which improved after treatment with acetaminophen. He appears lethargic and cannot recall what happened during the episode. His vital signs are within normal limits. He is oriented to time, place, and person. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. There is muscular pain at attempts to elicit deep tendon reflexes. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities.
