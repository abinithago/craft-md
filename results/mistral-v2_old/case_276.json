{"case_id": "case_276", "case_vignette": "A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of slurred speech and left facial droop for the past 30 minutes. During this period, she has also had numbness on the left side of her face. She has never had such an episode before. She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her father died of lung cancer 1 week ago. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. She drinks one glass of wine daily. Her current medications include metformin, sitagliptin, enalapril, and atorvastatin. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 30.5 kg/m2. She is oriented to time, place, and person. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.7\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Examination shows drooping of the left side of the face. Her speech is clear. Examination shows full muscle strength. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. A finger-nose test and her gait are normal. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a right-sided carotid bruit. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within the reference ranges. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. A noncontrast CT scan of the brain shows no abnormalities. On the way back from the CT scan, her presenting symptoms resolve.
