She works in accounting and has been under more stress than usual lately. She takes no medications. She appears pale. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.1\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 126/78 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a bilateral hand tremor with outstretched arms and a palpable thyroid nodule in the left lobe. Serum laboratory studies show a thyroid stimulating hormone level of 0.03 \u03bcU/mL and a thyroxine level of 28 \u03bcg/dL. A radioactive iodine uptake scan shows enhancement in a 3-cm encapsulated nodule in the lower left lobe with decreased uptake in the remaining gland.
