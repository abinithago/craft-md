The menarche occurred at age 11, and the menopause was at age 53. She does not have any children and has never been sexually active. Her last screening mammogram 10 months ago was normal. The family history is significant for her mother dying from a myocardial infarction (MI) at age 68, her sister dying from metastatic breast cancer at age 55, and for colon cancer in her paternal grandfather. The review of systems is notable for unintentional weight loss of 3.6 kg (8 lb) in the past month. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u2103 (98.6\u2109), blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
