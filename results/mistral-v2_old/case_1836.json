{"case_id": "case_1836", "case_vignette": "A 27-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for foot pain. The patient states that she has pain in her foot and toes whenever she exerts herself or is at work. The patient is an executive at a medical device company and works 60 hours/week. She is currently training for a marathon. She has a past medical history of anxiety, constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome. Her current medications include clonazepam, sodium docusate, and hyoscyamine. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, pulse is 50/min, respirations are 10/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Cardiac and pulmonary exams are within normal limits. Examination of the lower extremity reveals 5/5 strength with 2+ reflexes. Palpation of the interdigital space between the third and fourth toes elicits pain and a clicking sound.
