At that time, he was prescribed fluoxetine, which he did not take because he believed that his symptoms would subside on their own. A few months later, his wife says that he suddenly came out of his feelings of \u2018depression\u2019 and began to be more excitable and show pressured speech. She observed that he slept very little but had a heightened interest in sexual activity. This lasted for a few weeks, and he went back to his depressed state. He has continued to experience feelings of sadness and shows a lack of concentration at work. She often finds him crying, and he also expresses feelings of guilt for all the wrongs he allegedly did to her and to the family. There was a week where he had a brief time of excitability and was considering donating all their savings to a local charity. She is highly perturbed by his behavior and often finds it hard to predict what his mood will be like next. The patient denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations. A urine toxicology screen is negative. All laboratory tests, including thyroid hormone levels, are normal.
