A complete blood count reveals thrombocytosis of 700,000 cells/m3. Lab work further shows decreased serum iron, iron saturation, and serum ferritin and increased total iron binding capacity. A blood smear reveals an increased number of abnormal platelets, and a bone marrow aspirate confirmed the presence of dysplastic megakaryocytes. A mutation on his chromosome 9 confirms the physician\u2019s suspicion of a certain clonal myeloproliferative disease. The patient is started on hydroxyurea.
