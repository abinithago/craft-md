He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, ischemic heart disease, and a 48-pack-year cigarette smoking history. He takes atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, labetalol, and metformin. His blood pressure is 132/82 mm Hg, the pulse is 72/min, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. All cranial nerves are intact. Muscle strength is normal in all limbs. Perception of sharp stimuli and temperature is reduced on his shoulders and upper arms. The vibratory sense is preserved.
