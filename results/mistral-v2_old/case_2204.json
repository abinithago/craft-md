Despite albuterol, ipratropium, magnesium, methylprednisolone, and high flow nasal cannula, the patient agrees to elective intubation and is transferred to the intensive care unit. His hospital course is prolonged by pneumonia, which is managed with vancomycin, pipercillin-tazobactam, and gentamicin to cover for ventilator-associated etiologies. He is maintained on nasogastric tube feeds, lactated ringer fluid boluses, and subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. On hospital day 7, the patient proves difficult to wean from his ventilator due to labored tachypnea. As the nurse rotates the patient to change his sacral pressure ulcer dressing, the patient's peak airway pressure increases sharply to 55 cm H2O. The nurse noted that the patient was wincing at the time. His temperature is 100.1\u00b0F (38.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/50 mmHg, and pulse is 100/min.
