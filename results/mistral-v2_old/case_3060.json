Due to this reason she mostly avoids eating. She says she has lost a few pounds in the last couple of months. She is a smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. Past medical history is insignificant except for chronic knee pain, for which she takes over the counter painkillers. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 120/89 mm Hg.
