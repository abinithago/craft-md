He drinks 2-7 alcoholic drinks per day and has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes per day since he was 25. The patient admits to using anabolic steroids. He has lost 17 pounds since he last came to the emergency department 1 month ago.

Physical exam reveals decreased sensation in the right arm and 2/5 strength in the right arm and 5/5 strength in in the left arm.
