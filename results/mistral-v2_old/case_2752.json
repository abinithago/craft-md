Today, his heart rate is 100/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, blood pressure is 105/65 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.2\u00baC (99.0\u00b0F). On physical examination, he appears unwell with poor skin turgor and dry oral mucosa. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is sensitive to shallow and deep palpation. A gross examination of the stool reveals a \u2018rice water\u2019 appearance. Diagnostic microbiology results are pending.
