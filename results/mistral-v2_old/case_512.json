Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of placental abruption. Current medications include iron and vitamin supplements. Her immunizations are up-to-date.

Speculum examination confirms rupture of membranes with drainage of malodorous, blood-tinged fluid. Ultrasonography shows the fetus in a cephalic presentation. The fetal heart rate is 175/min and reactive with no decelerations.
