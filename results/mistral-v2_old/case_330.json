Hemoglobin electrophoresis is the gold standard test for diagnosing hemolytic anemia, particularly for identifying abnormal hemoglobin variants or quantifying the percentage of fetal hemoglobin. The other mentioned tests, such as the fluorescent spot test, indirect antiglobulin test, and Eosin-5-maleimide binding test, are used to detect the presence of antibodies or complement components in the blood, which may be indicative of an autoimmune hemolytic anemia or other causes of hemolysis.", "vignette_frq": "The given laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of sickle cell anemia.
