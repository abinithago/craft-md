{"case_id": "case_2768", "case_vignette": "A 68-year-old man seeks evaluation by a physician with complaints of worsening forgetfulness and confusion for 1 year. According to his wife, he has always been in good health and is generally very happy; however, he has started to forget important things. He recently had his driving license revoked because of multiple tickets, but he cannot recall having done anything wrong. This morning, he neglected to put on his socks and was quite agitated when she pointed this out to him. He denies having a depressed mood, sleep problems, or loss of interest. He occasionally has a glass of wine with dinner and has never smoked or used recreational drugs. His medical history and family medical history are unremarkable. His pulse is 68/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. Except for a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of 20/30, the remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray and CT of the brain, reveal no pathologic findings. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is also normal. Laboratory testing showed the following:\nSerum glucose (fasting) 76 mg/dL\nSerum electrolytes:  \nSodium 140 mEq/L\nPotassium 4.1 mEq/L\nChloride 100 mEq/L\nSerum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL\nBlood urea nitrogen 11 mg/dL\nCholesterol, total: 180 mg/dL\nHDL-cholesterol 45 mg/dL\nLDL-cholesterol 75 mg/dL\nTriglycerides 135 mg/dL\nHemoglobin (Hb%) 16 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV)  85 fL\nReticulocyte count 0.9%\nErythrocyte count 5 million/mm\u00b3\nThyroid-stimulating hormone 3.5 \u00b5U/mL\nUrinalysis \nGlucose Negative\nKetones Negative\nLeucocytes Negative\nNitrite Negative\nRBCs Negative\nCasts Negative\n", "question": "Which  is the most likely diagnosis?", "correct_ans": "alzheimer\u2019s dementia", "trial_0": {"multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Neurology.
