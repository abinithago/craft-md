The primary and secondary survey are performed and are only notable for bruising along her chest wall bilaterally. An initial pelvic radiograph, an electrocardiogram (ECG) are performed and are unremarkable. A chest radiograph is performed and is notable for a sternal fracture and several rib fractures. The patient is given morphine and her heart rate subsequently improves to 80/min. The patient is observed in the emergency department over the next 6 hours and her laboratory values and a repeat ECG return within normal limits. The patient suddenly complains of shortness of breath.
