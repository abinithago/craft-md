{"case_id": "case_661", "case_vignette": "A 36-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, has back pain and numbness in her lower extremities after an emergency cesarean delivery of a healthy 3856-g (8-lb, 8-oz) newborn male. She had a placental abruption and lost approximately 2000 ml of blood. During the procedure, she received two units of packed red blood cells and intravenous fluids. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is sexually active with one male partner, and they use condoms inconsistently. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 94/58 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased sensation to temperature and pinprick below her waist and 0/5 muscle strength in her lower extremities. She feels the vibrations of a tuning fork placed on both of her great toes. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 2+ in the upper extremities.
