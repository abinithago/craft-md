His parents report that he often fails to answer when they call him and has regular unprovoked episodes of crying and screaming. At kindergarten, he can follow and participate in group activities, but does not follow his teacher's instructions when these are given to him directly. He is otherwise cheerful and maintains eye contact when spoken to but does not respond when engaged in play. He gets along well with friends and family. He started walking at the age of 11 months and can speak in two-to-three-word phrases. He often mispronounces words.
