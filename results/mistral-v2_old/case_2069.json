She also endorses headaches that typically resolve by the middle of the day and a 5 pound weight gain this past month. The patient has a past medical history of obesity, schizophrenia, and constipation.

On physical exam, you note an obese, fatigued-appearing woman. Dermatologic exam reveals fine, thin hair over her body. Cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits.
