He has anxiety and takes alprazolam as needed. He smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily and drinks two glasses of wine with dinner each night. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), pulse is 70/min and regular, respirations are 13/min, blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg when supine and 122/80 mm Hg while standing. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. A complete blood count shows no abnormalities. Bedside cardiac monitoring shows infrequent premature ventricular contractions and QRS voltage below 5 mm in leads II and III.
