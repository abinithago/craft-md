He had similar symptoms last summer. He works as an analyst for a large hedge fund management company and spends the majority of his time at the computer. He has been under a lot of stress because of overdue paperwork. He also has chronic shoulder pain. He has been using indomethacin every 6 hours for the pain but has had no relief. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. He appears restless. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows drooping of the right eyelid, tearing of the right eye, and rhinorrhea. The right pupil is 2 mm and the left pupil is 4 mm. There is localized tenderness to his right supraspinatus muscle. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.
