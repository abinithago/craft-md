The pain is worse after eating, which she reports as 7 out of 10 in intensity. Over the last year, she has also had nausea, heartburn, and multiple episodes of diarrhea with no blood or mucus. Eight months ago, she underwent an upper endoscopy, which showed several ulcers in the gastric antrum, the pylorus, and the duodenum, as well as thick gastric folds. The biopsies from these ulcers were negative for H. pylori. Current medications include pantoprazole and over-the-counter antacids. She appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and there is tenderness to palpation in the epigastric and umbilical areas. Test of the stool for occult blood is positive. A repeat upper endoscopy shows persistent gastric and duodenal ulceration with minimal bleeding.
