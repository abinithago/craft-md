{"case_id": "case_3045", "case_vignette": "A 50-year-old man presents to his physician with chronic cough, aching joints in his hips and lower back, and malaise over the past 2 months. He describes himself as being \u201cgenerally healthy\u201d before the cough began. Past medical history includes hypertension. The patient takes clopamide and a multivitamin daily. His parents are both well and living in a senior living facility. He does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, the patient described a hiking trip in and around the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, 4 months ago. At the office, his temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 120/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild fremetus and dullness with percussion on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a right-sided consolidation of the lower right lung, and a chest CT shows an irregular opacity measuring 3.8 cm x 3.0 cm in the sub-plural region of the right middle lobe, a small right-sided pleural effusion, and mild right-sided hilar adenopathy. A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in the surrounding tissues. The laboratory tests show the following results:\nHemoglobin 12.9 mg/dL\nLeukocyte count 9,300/mm3\nPlatelet count 167,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 43 mm/hr\nPeriodic acid-Schiff and silver methenamine Positive\nAcid-fast stain Negative\n ", "question": "Which  is the most likely diagnosis?", "correct_ans": "valley fever", "trial_0": {"multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Infectious Diseases.
