She has a ventricular septum defect that was diagnosed at birth. The patient appears lethargic. Her temperature is 38.4 (101.1\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 34/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Examination shows small, non-blanching, purple lesions on her palms, soles, and under her fingernails. There is edema of the eyelids and feet. Funduscopic examination shows retinal hemorrhages. Holosystolic and early diastolic murmurs are heard. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 11.3 g/dL\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 61 mm/h\nLeukocyte count 15,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 326,000/mm3\nUrine\nBlood 4+\nGlucose negative\nProtein 1+\nKetones negative\nTransthoracic echocardiography shows a small outlet ventricular septum defect and a mild right ventricular enlargement.
