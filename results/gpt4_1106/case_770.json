A telephone call with the police department of her hometown reveals that she had been reported missing three days ago by her husband. When the husband arrives, he reports that his wife has had a great deal of stress at work lately and before she went missing, was anxious to tell her boss that she will not meet the deadline for her current project. She has had two major depressive episodes within the past 4 years that were treated with citalopram. She drinks one to two beers daily and sometimes more on weekends. She does not use illicit drugs. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status exam, she is oriented only to time and place but not to person. Short-term memory is intact; she does not recognize her husband or recall important events of her life.
