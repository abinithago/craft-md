However, 2 months ago, when he found out about the death of their mother, he showed little emotion and attended her funeral in jeans and a dirty T-shirt which upset the rest of their family. When asked about it, he shrugged and said he was in a hurry to get to the funeral and \u201cjust left the house with what I had on.\u201d He does not speak much during the interview, allowing his sister to speak on his behalf. His sister insists that he has \u2018always been like this\u2019, quiet and a complacent child who had no interest in playing with other children.
