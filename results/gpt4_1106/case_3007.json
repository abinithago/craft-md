These screening studies are unremarkable except for her chest X-ray, which shows a 2 cm isolated pulmonary nodule in the middle lobe of the right lung. The nodule has poorly defined margins, and it shows a dense, irregular pattern of calcification. The patient is immediately referred to a pulmonologist for evaluation of the lesion. The patient denies any recent illnesses and states that she has not traveled outside of the country since she was a child.
