Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 81%. There are several scattered petechiae on the anterior chest wall. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 9,000/mm3, a platelet count of 145,000/mm3, and a creatine kinase of 190 U/L. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia.
