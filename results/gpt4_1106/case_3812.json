{"case_id": "case_3812", "case_vignette": "A 39-year-old man presents to a primary care clinic for a routine physical exam. He denies any complaints. He has a long beard and hair, wears several copper bracelets, and a crystal amulet. When asked about his diet, he discloses eating mostly canned foods, which he has stockpiled in his cabin in case there is a natural disaster or \"apocalypse\" (though he admits that this is highly unlikely). He has a few close friends, but feels awkward when meeting new people. He seems happy overall and has many long-standing interests, including hiking and astrology. He has been steadily employed as a data scientist and a paranormal investigator. He has never been diagnosed with a mental illness, though he has a family history of schizophrenia. Review of systems is negative for depressed mood, anxiety, or hallucinations. Thought process is linear and reality testing is intact.
