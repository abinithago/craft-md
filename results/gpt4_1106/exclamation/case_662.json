Her temperature is 36!8\u00b0C (98!2\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 105/65 mm Hg! She has a broad-based gait! While standing with both feet together and raising her arms, closing her eyes does not affect her balance! She is unable to perform rapid, alternating movements with her hands! An MRI of the brain is shown! ",

Ask different questions to cover more information. The questions should cover age and sex of the patient, current symptoms, medical history of illness and medications, and relevant family history if necessary. Keep your questions short and brief to not confuse the patient.  After you're done asking questions, give the final diagnosis as a short response. Do not explain, only give the diagnosis name.
