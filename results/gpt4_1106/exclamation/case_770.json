She is unable to recall her name, address, or any other information regarding her person! She denies being the woman on a Connecticut driver's license found in her wallet! A telephone call with the police department of her hometown reveals that she had been reported missing three days ago by her husband! When the husband arrives, he reports that his wife has had a great deal of stress at work lately and before she went missing, was anxious to tell her boss that she will not meet the deadline for her current project! She has had two major depressive episodes within the past 4 years that were treated with citalopram! She drinks one to two beers daily and sometimes more on weekends! She does not use illicit drugs! Her vital signs are within normal limits! Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities! On mental status exam, she is oriented only to time and place but not to person! Short-term memory is intact; she does not recognize her husband or recall important events of her life! ",

Ask different questions to cover more information. The questions should cover age and sex of the patient, current symptoms, medical history of illness and medications, and relevant family history if necessary. Keep your questions short and brief to not confuse the patient.  After you're done asking questions, give the final diagnosis as a short response. Do not explain, only give the diagnosis name. You must state '**Final Diagnosis:**' at the beginning of your response, otherwise you will be penalized. You must give only 1 diagnosis otherwise you will be penalized."
