Additionally, there have been no changes in his weight, nor has he experienced fevers or night sweats. There is no family history of cancer or bone diseases. Recently, he underwent blood tests and an x-ray of his skull. The results revealed a low hemoglobin level at 10.5 g/dl, high serum calcium at 11.1 mg/dl, and an alkaline phosphatase level of 110 U/L.",

Ask different questions to cover more information. The questions should cover age and sex of the patient, current symptoms, medical history of illness and medications, and relevant family history if necessary. Keep your questions short and brief to not confuse the patient.  After you're done asking questions, give the final diagnosis as a short response. Do not explain, only give the diagnosis name.
