This initiated after the patient lost a job as a store clerk four months ago. The patient reports no trouble sleeping or changes in appetite. The patient consumes beer on the weekends and does not use any new medications or increased caffeine intake. The patient also notes a mild tremulousness, described as slight shaking, which appears to correlate with the patient's financial worries, exacerbated by borrowing money from relatives and attempts to regain funds through betting.",
