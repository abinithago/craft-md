He is at the 95 percentile for height, 20 percentile for weight, and 95 percentile for head circumference! He appears shy! His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98!6\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 100/55 mm Hg! Examination shows elongated facial features and large ears! The patient does not speak!
