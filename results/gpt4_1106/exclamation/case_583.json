His temperature is 38!6\u00b0C (101!5\u00b0F), pulse is 180/min, and blood pressure is 82/51 mm Hg! Examination shows scleral icterus! He becomes more agitated when picked up! There is full range of motion of his neck and extremities! The anterior fontanelle feels soft and flat! Neurologic examination shows no abnormalities! Blood cultures are drawn and fluid resuscitation is initiated! A urinalysis obtained by catheterization shows no abnormalities! ",
