Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pressure is 138/88 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 18/min. Inspection of the hands demonstrates the physical examination findings present in Figure A. Additionally, a rash on the right elbow is identified and pictured in Figure B. The distal interphalangeal joints of the left hand are tender to palpation, as is the second distal interphalangeal joint of the right hand. The Achilles tendons are tender bilaterally, and ultrasonography is consistent with mild Achilles tendonitis bilaterally. Testing for HLA-B27 is positive.
