{"case_id": "case_1711", "case_vignette": "A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance. The patient was found unconscious in his bedroom after a suicide attempt. The patient had cut his wrists using a kitchen knife. The patient is unresponsive and pale. His temperature is 96\u00b0F (35.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 70/35 mmHg, pulse is 190/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Pressure is applied to his bilateral wrist lacerations. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is 7. A full trauma assessment is performed and reveals no other injuries. IV fluids are started as well as a rapid transfusion sequence. Norepinephrine is administered. Repeat vitals demonstrate that his blood pressure is 100/65 mmHg and pulse is 100/min. The patient is responsive and seems mildly confused. Resuscitation is continued and the patient's GCS improves to 15. Thirty minutes later, the patient's GCS is 11.
