{"case_vignette": "A 68-year-old man comes to the physician 3 months after noticing skin changes on his scalp. When he scrapes off the crust of the lesion, it reappears after a few days. Occasionally, his scalp itches or he notices a burning sensation. He had a mole removed on his right forearm 5 years ago. He is a retired winemaker. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows multiple rough patches on his scalp. A photograph is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Actinic keratosis\nB) Multiple seborrheic keratoses\nC) D) Basal cell carcinoma\nD) E) Squamous cell carcinoma\nAnswer: B) Multiple seborrheic keratoses\nExplanation: Seborrheic keratoses are benign growths that are common in older adults. They are usually multiple and are found on sun-exposed areas of the body. They are rough to the touch and may be pigmented. They are not cancerous and do not require treatment unless they are cosmetically bothersome. Actinic keratosis is a precancerous lesion that is caused by sun exposure. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are types of skin cancer. The patient's history of a mole removal is not relevant to the diagnosis of seborrheic keratoses. The patient's occupation as a winemaker is not relevant to the diagnosis of seborrheic keratoses. The patient's symptoms of itching and burning are not specific to seborrheic keratoses, but they are common in many skin conditions. The patient's age and the location of the lesions are consistent with seborrheic keratoses. The photograph is not provided, but it would likely show multiple rough patches on the scalp.\nThe rewritten text would be:\nA 68-year-old person comes to the physician 3 months after noticing skin changes on their scalp.
