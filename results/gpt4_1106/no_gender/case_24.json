The patient has a history of prematurity and low birthweight but is otherwise healthy. The patient has no relevant social or family history. The patient\u2019s mother is concerned that the hair loss may be a sign of a serious underlying condition. The patient\u2019s pediatrician has ordered a biopsy to rule out a condition called aplasia cutis congenita, which is a rare congenital disorder characterized by a hairless patch of skin. The patient\u2019s pediatrician is also considering a diagnosis of congenital alopecia areata, which is a condition in which the immune system attacks the hair follicles, causing hair loss. The patient\u2019s pediatrician is concerned that the patient may have a condition that requires further evaluation and treatment.\nRewritten text:\nA 1-year-old child presents with a single, L-shaped, yellow-orange hairless patch over the left preauricular skin.
