{"case_vignette": "An 8-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 3 hours after having a 2-minute episode of violent, jerky movements of his right arm at school. He was sweating profusely during the episode and did not lose consciousness. He remembers having felt a chill down his spine before the episode. Following the episode, he experienced weakness in the right arm and was not able to lift it above his head for 2 hours. Three weeks ago, he had a sore throat that resolved with over-the-counter medication. He was born at term and his mother remembers him having an episode of jerky movements when he had a high-grade fever as a toddler. There is no family history of serious illness, although his father passed away in a motor vehicle accident approximately 1 year ago. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 94/54 mm Hg. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of glucose, electrolytes, calcium, and creatinine are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Absence seizure B) Tonic-clonic seizure C) Myoclonic seizure D) Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers E) Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\n\n## Step 1: Identify the gender-specific references in the text.\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"An 8-year-old boy\", \"his mother\", \"his father\".\n\n## Step 2: Rewrite the text to remove the gender-specific references.\nThe text should be rewritten to remove the gender-specific references, making it more inclusive and neutral.
