{"case_vignette": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician in December for episodic shortness of breath and a nonproductive cough for 3 months. These episodes frequently occur before sleeping, and he occasionally wakes up because of difficulty breathing. His mother also reports that he became short of breath while playing with his friends at daycare on several occasions. He is allergic to peanuts. He is at the 55th percentile for height and weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows mild scattered wheezing in the thorax. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Asthma\nB) C) Cystic fibrosis\nC) C) Croup\nD) C) Pneumonia\nAnswer: A) Asthma\nExplanation: Asthma is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The child's symptoms of episodic shortness of breath and nonproductive cough, especially at night, are classic for asthma. The child's history of allergies to peanuts also increases the likelihood of asthma. The child's normal chest x-ray and lack of other symptoms such as fever or sputum production also make asthma the most likely diagnosis. Cystic fibrosis is unlikely because the child's sweat chloride test is not mentioned, and the child's symptoms do not include chronic cough or failure to thrive. Croup is unlikely because the child's symptoms do not include a barking cough or stridor. Pneumonia is unlikely because the child's chest x-ray is normal and the child does not have a fever or other symptoms of infection. \nThe best answer is A. \nNote: The original text contained a gender-specific reference (\"he\") that was removed in the rewritten text. The rewritten text uses gender-neutral language throughout. \n\nHere is the rewritten text:\nA 4-year-old child is brought to the physician in December for episodic shortness of breath and a nonproductive cough for 3 months.
