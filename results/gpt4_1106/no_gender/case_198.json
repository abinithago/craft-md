They report a tingling sensation prior to the eruption of red small spots that became more yellow and pus filled. They deny any trauma or topical products applied to the area. They have a history of cold sores on the lips. Physical examination reveals multiple clustered painful, white-yellow vesicles on the right index finger on erythematous pink base. The patient is a college student and is otherwise healthy.\nNote: I removed the word \"male\" and replaced it with \"patient\", which is a more neutral term. I also removed the pronoun \"he\" and replaced it with \"they\", which is a more inclusive pronoun. This rewritten text maintains the same meaning and clarity as the original text, but without any gender-specific references. This is an example of how to make language more inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Herpetic whitlow", "vignette_frq": "Herpetic Whitlow", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
