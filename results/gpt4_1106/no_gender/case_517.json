{"case_vignette": "A 7-year-old girl comes in to the emergency department with her mother for swelling of her left periorbital region. Yesterday morning she woke up with a painful, warm, soft lump on her left eyelid. Eye movement does not worsen the pain. Physical examination shows redness and swelling of the upper left eyelid, involving the hair follicles. Upon palpation, the swelling drains purulent fluid. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Preseptal cellulitis, B) Orbital cellulitis, C) D) Eosinophilic cellulitis, E) Erysipelas.\n## Step 1: Identify the gender-specific references in the text.\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"7-year-old girl\", \"her mother\", \"her left eyelid\", \"her left periorbital region\".\n\n## Step 2: Rewrite the text to remove the gender-specific references.\nThe text should be rewritten to remove all references to the patient's gender. This can be done by replacing \"girl\" with a more neutral term, such as \"child\" or \"patient\", and removing the references to the mother and the patient's gender.\n\n## Step 3: Replace the gender-specific references with neutral language.\nThe rewritten text should read: A 7-year-old child comes in to the emergency department with a parent for swelling of the left periorbital region. Yesterday morning the child woke up with a painful, warm, soft lump on the left eyelid. Eye movement does not worsen the pain. Physical examination shows redness and swelling of the upper left eyelid, involving the hair follicles. Upon palpation, the swelling drains purulent fluid. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Preseptal cellulitis, B) Orbital cellulitis, C) D) Eosinophilic cellulitis, E) Erysipelas.\n\n## Step 4: Review the rewritten text for accuracy and clarity.\nThe rewritten text should be reviewed to ensure that it accurately conveys the original meaning and is clear and concise.\n\nThe final answer is: There is no final numerical answer for this problem, as it involves rewriting a text to remove gender-specific references. However, the rewritten text is provided above.  A) Preseptal cellulitis.  This is the most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms described.
