{"case_vignette": "A 17-year-old male presents with a several year history of a spot on the neck that developed acute onset pain for the past 3 days and warmth. On examination along the left lateral neck is a tender, soft skin colored nodule. Biopsy is performed and reveals stratified squamous epithelium with surrounding lymphoid tissue.  The patient is diagnosed with a branchial cleft cyst.\nThe patient is a 17-year-old who presents with a several year history of a spot on the neck that developed acute onset pain for the past 3 days and warmth. On examination along the left lateral neck is a tender, soft skin-colored nodule. Biopsy is performed and reveals stratified squamous epithelium with surrounding lymphoid tissue.  The patient is diagnosed with a branchial cleft cyst. \nNote: The original text was already quite neutral in terms of gender-specific language, so the rewritten text is very similar to the original. The only change made was to remove the word \"male\" from the first sentence. However, it's worth noting that the original text could be made even more neutral by avoiding the use of words like \"lateral\" which have a slightly masculine connotation. A more neutral term like \"left side\" could be used instead. \nHere is the revised text with the suggested change:\nA 17-year-old patient presents with a several year history of a spot on the neck that developed acute onset pain for the past 3 days and warmth. On examination along the left side of the neck is a tender, soft skin-colored nodule. Biopsy is performed and reveals stratified squamous epithelium with surrounding lymphoid tissue.  The patient is diagnosed with a branchial cleft cyst. \nHowever, it's worth noting that the term \"left side\" is still somewhat ambiguous and could be interpreted as referring to the left side of the body, rather than the left side of the neck specifically. A more precise term like \"left neck\" or \"left side of the neck\" could be used to avoid any potential ambiguity. \nHere is the revised text with the suggested change:\nA 17-year-old patient presents with a several year history of a spot on the neck that developed acute onset pain for the past 3 days and warmth.
