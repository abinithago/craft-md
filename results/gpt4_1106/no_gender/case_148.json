The patient cannot recall when they first started. The patient denies any drug or alcohol use. The patient is not currently taking their antiretroviral therapy. Examination reveals multiple ovoid violaceous ruddy, brown ovoid macules on the trunk, legs, oral palate and plantar feet. A punch biopsy is performed and stains for HHV-8 is positive.   The patient is diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma.\nNote: I removed the word \"male\" and replaced it with \"patient\" to make the text more inclusive. I also removed the word \"he\" and replaced it with \"the patient\" to make the text more inclusive. I did not change the rest of the text, as it does not contain any gender-specific language. \nIt's worth noting that the original text does not contain any language that is overtly discriminatory or biased towards a particular gender. The use of the word \"male\" is simply a demographic descriptor, and the text does not contain any language that implies that the disease or symptoms are more common or severe in one gender than the other. However, using inclusive language can help to create a more welcoming and respectful environment for patients of all genders. \nIt's also worth noting that the term \"patient\" is a more neutral term than \"male\" or \"female\", as it does not imply a specific gender or identity. Using the term \"patient\" can help to create a more inclusive and respectful environment for patients of all genders and identities.  In addition, using the term \"patient\" can help to avoid making assumptions about a patient's gender or identity, and can help to create a more neutral and respectful tone in medical writing.
