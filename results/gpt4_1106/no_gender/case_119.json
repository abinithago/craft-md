Physical exam reveals a red-brown well delimited plaque on their left leg without any noticeable erythema or epidermal changes. The patient is otherwise healthy and has no other symptoms.\nNote: I removed the word \"female\" and replaced it with \"child\", and also changed \"her\" to \"their\" to make the text more inclusive. I also changed \"she\" to \"they\" to make the text more inclusive. I did not change the pronouns in the sentence \"The parents mentions that...\" because the subject of the sentence is \"parents\", which is a plural noun and does not have a specific gender. However, if the text were to be rewritten to make it more inclusive, the sentence could be rephrased to \"The parents mention that...\" to make it clear that the parents are a plural entity. \n\nIt's worth noting that the original text does not contain any language that is overtly discriminatory or biased, and the changes made in the rewritten text are primarily to make the language more inclusive and neutral. However, in some cases, removing gender-specific language can also help to avoid assumptions or stereotypes that may be implicit in the original text. \n\nIn this case, the original text does not contain any language that suggests a particular gender or stereotype, and the changes made in the rewritten text are primarily to make the language more neutral and inclusive.
