The patient is diagnosed with primary syphilis and is treated with penicillin G benzathine.\n\nNote: I removed the following gender-specific references:\n- \"male\" and \"female\" to make the language more inclusive\n- \"penile coronal sulcus and dorsal shaft\" to make the description of the physical examination more general, without referencing a specific body part that is typically associated with males\n- \"he\" and \"him\" to use more neutral pronouns, such as \"they\" and \"them\" to refer to the patient. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the rewritten text still uses the pronoun \"they\" which is not entirely neutral, as it is often used to refer to a group of people rather than an individual. A more neutral option would be to use the pronoun \"the patient\" or \"the individual\" instead of \"they\". \n\nHere is the revised text with the pronoun \"the patient\" used instead of \"they\":\n\nA 29-year-old patient presents with painful genital ulcers ongoing for the past 3 months.
