{"case_vignette": "Five days after undergoing an open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, a 68-year-old woman has crampy abdominal pain. During this period, she has also had two episodes of loose, bloody stools. Her surgery was complicated by severe blood loss requiring the administration of vasopressors and multiple transfusions. Cefazolin was administered as a perioperative antibiotic. The patient has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years and drinks 3\u20134 glasses of wine every week. Her current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin, amlodipine, aspirin, and metoprolol. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 96/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a distended abdomen with absent bowel sounds. The abdomen is exquisitely tender to palpation in all quadrants. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows an S4 gallop. An x-ray of the abdomen shows air-filled distended bowel. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \n\nThe answer is: \n\nA. Ileus\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe patient has a history of abdominal surgery, severe blood loss, and the administration of vasopressors and multiple transfusions. These factors are associated with postoperative ileus. The patient's symptoms of crampy abdominal pain, loose, bloody stools, and distended abdomen with absent bowel sounds are consistent with ileus. The x-ray of the abdomen shows air-filled distended bowel, which is also consistent with ileus. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol use may contribute to the development of ileus, but these factors are not the primary cause of the patient's symptoms. \n\nNote: The patient's history of smoking and alcohol use may contribute to the development of ileus, but these factors are not the primary cause of the patient's symptoms. \n\nThe correct answer is A. Ileus. \n\nThe patient's symptoms and history are consistent with postoperative ileus, which is a common complication of abdominal surgery. The patient's crampy abdominal pain, loose, bloody stools, and distended abdomen with absent bowel sounds are all consistent with ileus.
