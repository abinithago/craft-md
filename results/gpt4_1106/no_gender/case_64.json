{"case_vignette": "A man, aged 68 years, with no known history of atopy presents with a 4-month history of an itchy and burning rash on the legs that has been recurring every winter for the past 3 years. He notes that he had dry skin at baseline and did not use emollients, but he did try hydrocortisone 1% cream without improvement. Examination revealed ovoid, erythematous, well-marginated plaques on the lower legs and dorsal feet with variable scaling and focal weeping and crusting. There were no nail changes, and the rest of his skin examination was notable only for xerosis. The patient's symptoms were exacerbated by cold weather and improved with the use of a humidifier. The patient's medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of smoking. He has a family history of atopy, but he does not have any personal history of atopy. The patient's medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, and a multivitamin. The patient's physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, a pulse of 72 beats per minute, and a body mass index (BMI) of 28.5 kg/m^2. The patient's laboratory results were notable for a normal complete blood count (CBC), normal electrolytes, and normal liver function tests. The patient's symptoms were consistent with a diagnosis of winter eczema, and he was prescribed a topical corticosteroid and a moisturizer. The patient was also advised to use a humidifier and to avoid cold weather.\n\nHere is the rewritten text with all gender-specific references removed:\nA person, aged 68 years, with no known history of atopy presents with a 4-month history of an itchy and burning rash on the legs that has been recurring every winter for the past 3 years.
