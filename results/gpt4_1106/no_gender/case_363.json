{"case_vignette": "A 17-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of increasingly withdrawn behavior for the last two years. His mother reports that in the last 2\u20133 years of high school, her son has spent most of his time in his room playing video games. He does not have any friends and has never had a girlfriend. He usually refuses to attend family dinner and avoids contact with his siblings. The patient states that he prefers being on his own. When asked how much playing video games means to him, he replies that \u201cit's okay.\u201d When his mother starts crying during the visit, he appears indifferent. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. On mental status examination, his thought process is organized and logical. His affect is flattened.  A) Schizophrenia, B) Major Depressive Disorder, C) D) Other specified mental disorder, E) Not elsewhere classified.\nThe correct answer is A) Schizophrenia. The patient's lack of motivation, social withdrawal, and lack of interest in activities that he used to enjoy are all symptoms of schizophrenia. The patient's flattened affect and lack of emotional response to his mother's tears are also consistent with schizophrenia. The patient's thought process is organized and logical, which is not typical of schizophrenia. However, the patient's symptoms are not severe enough to meet the full criteria for schizophrenia, so the diagnosis is Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders.\nThe text has been rewritten to remove all gender-specific references:\nA 17-year-old individual is brought to the physician by a parent because of increasingly withdrawn behavior for the last two years.
