{"case_vignette": "A 59-year-old woman comes to the emergency department 25 minutes after the onset of severe left periorbital pain and blurred vision in the same eye. The pain began soon after she entered a theater to watch a movie. She has a headache and vomited twice on the way to the hospital. Two weeks ago, she had acute sinusitis that resolved spontaneously. She has atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Current medications include metoprolol and warfarin. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg. Visual acuity is counting fingers at 3 feet in the left eye and 20/20 in the right eye. The left eye shows conjunctival injection and edematous cornea. The left pupil is mid-dilated and irregular; it is not reactive to light. Extraocular movements are normal. Fundoscopic examination is inconclusive because of severe corneal edema. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Central retinal artery occlusion\nB) Central retinal vein occlusion\nC) D) Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy\nD) Central retinal vein occlusion\nE) None of the above\nAnswer: C) D) Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy\nThe patient's symptoms and examination findings are most consistent with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). The patient's age, history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation, and the sudden onset of severe periorbital pain and blurred vision in one eye are all risk factors for NAION. The patient's visual acuity is counting fingers at 3 feet in the left eye, and the left pupil is mid-dilated and irregular, which is consistent with optic nerve dysfunction. The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension also increases the risk of NAION. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with central retinal artery occlusion, central retinal vein occlusion, or other conditions. \nNote: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with central retinal artery occlusion, central retinal vein occlusion, or other conditions.
