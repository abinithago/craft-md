{"case_vignette": "A 62-year-old man with well-controlled rosacea, a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; stable on no current therapy) was seen in the clinic for a full-body skin check. Results of his examination were unremarkable except for the presence of periorbital, yellow-brown plaques with violaceous borders involving the upper and lower eyelids, bilaterally. There was induration, but no warmth or tenderness, of the periorbital plaques. He first noticed these lesions around the time he was diagnosed with CLL; initially they were more discrete yellow papules that developed into plaques over time. They are completely asymptomatic. The patient has been on a stable regimen of hydroxychloroquine for the 2 years prior to the visit, which has been effective in controlling his rosacea. He has no history of skin cancer or other skin conditions. His past medical history is significant for CLL, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and rosacea. His family history is significant for CLL in his father. The patient is a nonsmoker and has a history of moderate alcohol use. He has a body mass index (BMI) of 25.5 kg/m2. His physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. The patient's CLL has been stable for the past 2 years, and he has been on no current therapy. He has been on hydroxychloroquine for the past 2 years for his rosacea, which has been effective. He has no current symptoms or complaints.
