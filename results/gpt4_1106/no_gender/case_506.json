{"case_vignette": "A 24-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 33 weeks\u2019 gestation, is admitted to the hospital for treatment of preterm labor. She has no history of serious illness and her only medication is a multivitamin. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg. Therapy with nifedipine and betamethasone is begun. The patient continues to have contractions; nifedipine is discontinued and treatment with high-dose terbutaline is initiated. Her contractions resolve. Three hours later, the patient reports fatigue and weakness. Neurologic examination shows proximal muscle weakness of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? (Note: The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with a side effect of the medication she is taking.)\nA) A decrease in serum potassium levels\nB) A decrease in serum calcium levels\nC) A decrease in serum magnesium levels\nD) E) A decrease in serum sodium levels\nAnswer: C) A decrease in serum magnesium levels\nExplanation: The patient\u2019s symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and proximal muscle weakness are consistent with hypomagnesemia, a known side effect of high-dose terbutaline. The correct answer is C. A decrease in serum magnesium levels. The other options are incorrect because hypokalemia (A) would cause muscle weakness, but also would cause an increase in deep tendon reflexes, not a decrease. Hypocalcemia (B) would cause muscle cramps, not weakness. Hyponatremia (D) would cause confusion, not muscle weakness. (Skill 1a)\nThe following question requires the test-taker to apply knowledge of pharmacology to a clinical scenario. The question requires the test-taker to identify the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms, which are consistent with a side effect of the medication she is taking. The correct answer is based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and the known side effects of the medication she is taking. The other options are incorrect because they do not match the patient\u2019s symptoms or the known side effects of the medication.\nThis question requires the test-taker to apply knowledge of pharmacology to a clinical scenario, which is", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Serum electrolytes", "vignette_frq": "Hypomagnesemia", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Obstetrics and Gynecology.
