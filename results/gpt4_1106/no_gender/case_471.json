The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years and drinks 1\u20132 glasses of whiskey on weekends. His temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 140/78 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows a nontender lesion at the right root of the nose. An image of the lesion is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? The patient's family history of metastatic melanoma increases the risk of melanoma in this patient. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol use may also increase the risk of melanoma. The patient's history of sun exposure as a farmer may also increase the risk of melanoma. The patient's age and the size of the lesion are also risk factors for melanoma. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol use may also increase the risk of other types of skin cancer.
