{"case_vignette": "An 8-year-old male presents with 1 week of itchy blisters on the ears. He just recently returned from spring break with his family. He denies using any particular products on the ears before the rash. He says that this has occurred yearly for the last several years, always around the same time. He denies proximal muscle weakness. He denies flaking in the scalp. He denies any other symptoms. His family history is negative for any similar conditions. His physical examination is notable for itchy blisters on the ears, which are tender to the touch. The blisters are not weeping or crusting. The patient is otherwise healthy and has a normal growth pattern. The patient's mother reports that the blisters are worse when the patient is in the sun.\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of solar keratosis, also known as sunburn blisters. This condition is caused by prolonged exposure to the sun, and the blisters are a result of the skin's attempt to protect itself from the sun's rays. The patient's family history is negative for any similar conditions, which suggests that this is not a genetic condition. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of solar keratosis, and the patient's mother reports that the blisters are worse when the sun is out, which further supports this diagnosis.\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of solar keratosis, also known as sunburn blisters.
