{"case_vignette": "A 45-year-old woman presents with enlarging blood vessels on her tongue that recently have increased in size and number. Numerous 1- to 2-mm discrete red macules and papules are seen on her tongue, oral mucosa, nose, lower lip, and fingertips. She has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood as well as iron-deficiency anemia that has not responded to iron supplementation. Her father, who died at the age of 50, had similar symptoms. The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She is a nonsmoker and does not drink alcohol. Her family history is significant for a history of bleeding disorders.\nThe patient's symptoms are suggestive of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and telangiectasias. The patient's symptoms are consistent with the diagnosis of HHT, which is often associated with other systemic manifestations such as pulmonary AVMs, cerebral AVMs, and gastrointestinal AVMs. The patient's iron-deficiency anemia is likely related to chronic blood loss from the AVMs.\nThe patient's family history is significant for a history of bleeding disorders, which is consistent with the diagnosis of HHT. The patient's father had similar symptoms, which suggests that the patient may have inherited the genetic mutation that causes HHT.\nThe patient's symptoms and family history are consistent with the diagnosis of HHT. The patient should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation and management.\nRewritten text:\nA 45-year-old individual presents with enlarging blood vessels on the tongue that recently have increased in size and number.
