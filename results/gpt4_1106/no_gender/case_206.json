{"case_vignette": "A 65-year-old Asian woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. On questioning, she has had occasional night sweats during the past 2 months. She has not had fevers or weight loss. Seven months ago, she had an acute myocardial infarction and was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. She has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 37 years. Current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, ramipril, metoprolol, and esomeprazole. She is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 89 kg (207 lbs); BMI is 29.7 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37.4\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 145/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows an S4. There is a nontender skin lesion near the right large toenail. A photograph of the lesion is shown. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nThe patient's history of night sweats, along with the presence of a nontender skin lesion, suggests a diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, specifically mycosis fungoides. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of an S4 on cardiac examination are consistent with the patient's history of myocardial infarction. The patient's BMI is in the overweight range, which may contribute to the development of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient's medications are appropriate for her medical history.
