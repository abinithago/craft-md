Previous to the event, he had difficulty feeding and was lethargic. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Pregnancy and delivery of the mother's first 2 children were also uncomplicated. Medications of the mother include folic acid and a multivitamin. The mother's immunizations are up-to-date. The infant appears icteric. His vital signs are within normal limits. The infant's weight and length are at the 5th percentile, and his head circumference at the 99th percentile for gestational age. There are several purpura of the skin. Ocular examination shows posterior uveitis. The patient does not pass his auditory screening tests. Cranial ultrasonography shows ventricular dilatation, as well as hyperechoic foci within the cortex, basal ganglia, and periventricular region. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Congenital CMV infection B) Congenital toxoplasmosis C) Congenital syphilis D) Congenital rubella E) Fetal alcohol syndrome F) Congenital varicella-zoster infection G) Congenital herpes simplex infection H) Congenital HIV infection I) Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection J) Congenital toxoplasmosis\nThe correct answer is I) Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.\nThe text has been rewritten to remove all gender-specific references:\nA 2-day old newborn delivered vaginally at 36 weeks to a 29-year-old person, gravida 3, para 2, has generalized convulsions lasting 2 minutes.
