{"case_vignette": "A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of slurred speech and left facial droop for the past 30 minutes. During this period, she has also had numbness on the left side of her face. She has never had such an episode before. She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her father died of lung cancer 1 week ago. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. She drinks one glass of wine daily. Her current medications include metformin, sitagliptin, enalapril, and atorvastatin. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 30.5 kg/m2. She is oriented to time, place, and person. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.7\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Examination shows drooping of the left side of the face. Her speech is clear. Examination shows full muscle strength. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. A finger-nose test and her gait are normal. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a right-sided carotid bruit. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within the reference ranges. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. A noncontrast CT scan of the brain shows no abnormalities. On the way back from the CT scan, her presenting symptoms resolve. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Transient ischemic attack (TIA)\nB) Migraine\nC) Dizziness\nD) E) None of the above\nAnswer: A) Transient ischemic attack (TIA)\nThe patient's symptoms, including slurred speech and left facial droop, are classic for a transient ischemic attack (TIA). The fact that her symptoms resolved on the way back from the CT scan also supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking also increases her risk for a TIA. The patient's symptoms were not caused by a migraine, as her speech was clear and she did not report any headache or visual disturbances. The patient's symptoms were not caused by dizziness, as she was oriented to", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Transient ischemic attack", "vignette_frq": "A) Transient ischemic attack (TIA)", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Neurology.
