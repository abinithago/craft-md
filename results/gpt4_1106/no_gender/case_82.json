{"case_vignette": "A 65-year-old man of Middle Eastern descent presents with a tender, weeping mass on his right palm. Since appearing 8 months ago, the lesion has enlarged into a 0.9-cm, pink pedunculated nodule with abundant serous crust. The patient has no significant history of trauma. His medical history is significant for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and lung cancer, which was treated with right lobectomy. It is unclear what medications were used to treat his lung cancer. His current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, allopurinol, aspirin, and digoxin. The patient also presents with additional pink, scaly plaques on his right ankle, consistent with nummular eczema. The patient's family history is significant for a mother who died of breast cancer and a father who died of lung cancer. The patient's social history is significant for a 40-pack-year smoking history. The patient's physical examination is notable for a 0.9-cm, pink, pedunculated nodule on the right palm, with a serous crust. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results are notable for a slightly elevated white blood cell count. The patient's diagnosis is likely a keratoacanthoma, given the clinical presentation and the patient's history of lung cancer. The patient's treatment plan includes a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and a discussion of the risks and benefits of surgical excision.\n\nHere is the rewritten text with all gender-specific references removed:\nA 65-year-old individual of Middle Eastern descent presents with a tender, weeping mass on their right palm.
