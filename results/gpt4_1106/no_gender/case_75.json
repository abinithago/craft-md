On examination, there are several well-demarcated depigmented macules and patches on their lateral back. The patient is otherwise healthy and has no other symptoms.\n\nNote: I removed the word \"man\" and replaced it with \"person\", and also changed the pronouns from \"he\" and \"him\" to \"they\" and \"their\" to make the text more inclusive. This is a common practice in medical writing to make the language more neutral and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity. \n\nIt's worth noting that the original text already used a gender-neutral term \"Black\" to describe the patient's ethnicity, so no changes were needed in that regard. \n\nAlso, it's worth mentioning that using gender-neutral language is not only a matter of respect, but also a way to avoid perpetuating stereotypes and biases in medical writing. By using inclusive language, we can create a more welcoming and equitable environment for all individuals, including those who identify as non-binary or gender non-conforming. \n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to help with anything else! \n\nHere is the text with the changes highlighted:\nOriginal text:\nA 15-year-old Black **man** presents with a 1-year history of light spots on **his** back.
