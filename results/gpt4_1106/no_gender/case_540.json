{"case_vignette": "A 17-year-old girl comes to the emergency department with a 5-day history of severe abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting. She also has pain with urination. She is sexually active with one male partner, and they use condoms inconsistently. She experienced a burning pain when she last had sexual intercourse 3 days ago. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 days. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness in the lower quadrants. Pelvic examination shows cervical motion tenderness and purulent cervical discharge. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 15,000/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 100 mm/h. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\nB) Appendicitis\nC) D) Ectopic pregnancy\nD) Ovarian torsion\nE) Other\nAnswer: A) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\nStep-by-step reasoning process: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, vomiting, and pain with urination, along with the pelvic examination findings of cervical motion tenderness and purulent cervical discharge, are consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the female reproductive organs, often caused by sexually transmitted bacteria. The patient's history of inconsistent condom use and recent painful sexual intercourse also supports this diagnosis. The patient's laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 15,000/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 100 mm/h, which are both elevated and consistent with an infection. The patient's age and symptoms do not support the other options. Appendicitis typically presents with pain in the right lower quadrant, and ovarian torsion typically presents with acute pain and a palpable mass. Ectopic pregnancy is a possibility in sexually active women, but the patient's last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago, and she does not have any symptoms of pregnancy. Therefore, PID is the most likely diagnosis.\nThe best answer is A.
