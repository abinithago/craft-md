However, if the text were written in a more formal or professional tone, it would be more common to use \"the patient\" instead of \"you\" to refer to the patient. \n\nIt's worth noting that using gender-neutral language is not only more inclusive, but it also helps to avoid making assumptions about the patient's gender. This is especially important in medical writing, where the patient's gender may not be relevant to the diagnosis or treatment. \n\nAlso, it's worth noting that using \"the patient\" instead of \"he\" or \"she\" can make the text sound a bit more formal or stilted, but it's a small price to pay for the benefits", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Type II minocycline hyperpigmentation", "vignette_frq": "Minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation.", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
