{"case_vignette": "A 2-month-old male infant presents with a rash in the diaper area. It has been present for the last month.

His mom says that she was unable to make enough breastmilk and so has recently been feeding him from a new formula.

Physical exam reveals erythematous erosions in the diaper area, as well as peri-oral scaling and a shiny tongue. There is no rash on the scalp.

This is important for creating inclusive and respectful language in medical and other professional contexts. \n\nIt's worth noting that using gender-neutral language can also help to avoid perpetuating stereotypes and biases, and can make the language more accessible and clear for people of all genders. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask! \n\nAlso, I", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Acrodermatitis enteropathica", "vignette_frq": "Zinc deficiency", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
