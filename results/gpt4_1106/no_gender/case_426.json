{"case_vignette": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the last 3 months. During this period, he has complained of abdominal pain and fullness, and his parents feel that he has been eating less. His parents also report that his urine has appeared pink for several weeks. He has been performing poorly in school lately, with reports from teachers that he has not been paying attention in class and has been distracting to other students. He was born at term and has been healthy except for a history of several infantile seizures. His vital signs are within normal limits. He is at the 60th percentile for height and 20th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a palpable abdominal mass, abdominal tenderness in the left upper quadrant, and left costovertebral angle tenderness. There are several ellipsoid, hypopigmented macules on the back and legs and a 4-cm raised plaque of rough, dimpled skin on the right lower back that is the same color as the surrounding skin. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (Reproduated with permission from JAMA Pediatrics, 2013; 167(10): 931-936.)\n## Step 1: Identify and replace gender-specific language\nThe first step is to identify all instances of gender-specific language in the text. In this case, the text mentions a \"7-year-old boy\" and uses masculine pronouns such as \"he\" and \"him\" to refer to the patient.\n\n## Step 2: Replace gender-specific language with neutral language\nTo remove all gender-specific references, we need to replace the gender-specific language with neutral language. This can be done by changing the pronouns to neutral ones such as \"the patient\" or \"the child\" and removing any language that implies a specific gender.\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the text with neutral language\nHere is the rewritten text with all gender-specific references removed:\n\nA 7-year-old child is brought to the physician by their parents because of a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the last 3 months. During this period, the child has complained of abdominal pain and fullness, and the parents feel that the child has been eating less. The parents also report that the child's urine has appeared pink for several weeks.
