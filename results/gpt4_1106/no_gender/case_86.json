{"case_vignette": "A 35-year-old woman presents to the dermatology clinic with inflammation of her fingernails that first appeared 5 months ago and recently worsened. She reports wearing acrylic nails for the last year, removing them just before the clinic visit. On examination, the patient has erythema and swelling of the lateral nail folds and hyperpigmentation of the proximal nail folds of all fingers on her right hand. Examination also reveals nail dystrophy, onycholysis, and an absence of cuticles. She has not tried any treatments for this condition. The patient is a nonsmoker and has no history of skin cancer. She has a history of eczema and asthma, but these conditions are well-controlled. The patient is concerned about the appearance of her nails and the potential for long-term damage.\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with a condition known as paronychia, which is an inflammation of the nail fold. The patient's history of wearing acrylic nails and the recent removal of these nails may have contributed to the development of this condition. The patient's history of eczema and asthma may also have played a role in the development of paronychia. The patient's symptoms are likely to be caused by an allergic reaction to the acrylic nails or the chemicals used in their application. The patient's symptoms are likely to be self-limiting, but the patient may benefit from treatment to reduce the inflammation and prevent further damage to the nail.\nThe patient's treatment options include topical corticosteroids, oral antibiotics, and oral antihistamines. The patient may also benefit from avoiding further use of acrylic nails and using a nail strengthener to promote healthy nail growth. The patient should be advised to keep her nails clean and dry, and to avoid picking or biting her nails. The patient should also be advised to avoid using harsh chemicals on her nails.\nThe patient's condition is likely to be self-limiting, but the patient may benefit from treatment to reduce the inflammation and prevent further damage to the nail. The patient should be advised to follow up with the dermatology clinic in 2-3 weeks to assess the response to treatment and to make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.\nThe rewritten text should be free of all gender-specific references, using neutral language to describe the patient and their symptoms.
