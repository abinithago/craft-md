{"case_vignette": "A 56-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He has had mild pain in his left groin for 2 weeks. He was admitted to the hospital 1 month ago for myocardial infarction. Cardiac catheterization and angiography showed occlusion of the left anterior descending artery and he underwent placement of 2 stents. He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. There is no family history of serious illness. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, rosuvastatin, and enalapril. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. Examination shows a 3-cm (1.2-in), tender, pulsatile mass in the left thigh, below the inguinal ligament. There is mild erythema of the overlying skin. A loud murmur is heard on auscultation of the mass. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. There is no edema in the lower limbs. Femoral and pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \n\nThe rewritten text should be of the same quality and length as the original.\n\n## Step 1: Identify and replace gender-specific language\nThe original text contains the phrase \"A 56-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination.\" This phrase includes the gender-specific term \"man.\" To rewrite the text without gender-specific references, we can replace \"man\" with a more neutral term, such as \"patient\" or \"individual.\"\n\n## Step 2: Replace pronouns and nouns with neutral alternatives\nThe original text also contains pronouns and nouns that are specific to males, such as \"he,\" \"him,\" and \"his.\" To rewrite the text without gender-specific references, we can replace these pronouns and nouns with more neutral alternatives, such as \"the patient,\" \"the individual,\" or \"the person.\"\n\n## Step 3: Review the text for other potential biases\nIn addition to the obvious gender-specific language, the original text may contain other biases or assumptions that are not immediately apparent. For example, the text assumes that the patient is an adult and that the patient's health is the primary concern.
