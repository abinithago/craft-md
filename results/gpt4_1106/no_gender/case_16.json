{"case_vignette": "A 37-year-old man without a significant past medical history presents to the dermatology clinic with an itchy rash on his right hand that he has had for about 4 months. He had tried numerous over-the-counter hand creams and hydrocortisone cream with no improvement. Additional questioning revealed a 1-year-history of dry, itchy feet. As a construction worker, he wears occlusive, steel-toed work boots and often wears gloves. He is also right-handed. Examination of his hands reveals a normal left hand and a scaly right palm. Diffuse, fine, dry white scale was present on the plantar aspect of both feet. The patient's occupation and lifestyle suggest that he may be experiencing a form of occupational dermatitis. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hand eczema and foot eczema.
