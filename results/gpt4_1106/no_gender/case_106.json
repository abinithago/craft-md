I also changed \"aside from a recent bout of stomach flu which she thinks she got from a bad piece of chicken\" to \"aside from a recent bout of stomach flu which they think they got from a bad piece of chicken\" to make the language more inclusive. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the original text does not contain any language that is overtly discriminatory or biased towards a particular gender. The use of \"she\" and \"her\" is simply a convention in medical writing to refer to a female patient. The rewritten text is more inclusive, but it's not necessarily more accurate or clear. \n\nIn medical writing, it's generally recommended to use the patient's preferred pronouns, if they are known. If the patient's gender is not specified, it's best to use neutral language, such as \"the patient\" or \"the individual\".
