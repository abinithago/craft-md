{"case_vignette": "A 41-year-old woman comes to the physician because of bleeding from the nipple of her right breast for 3 months. There is no bleeding from the other breast. Menses occur at regular 30-day intervals and lasts for 5 days with moderate flow. Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 53 years. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She appears healthy. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.7\u00b0F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 118/70 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Breast examination shows bleeding of the right breast on application of pressure with no palpable mass. The left breast shows no abnormalities. There is no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Pelvic examination shows a normal vagina and cervix. Ultrasonography shows a dilated duct enclosing a well-defined solitary mass. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\nB) Papillary carcinoma\nC)  Intraductal papilloma\nD)  Fibroadenoma\nE)  Fibrocystic changes\nAnswer: C)  Intraductal papilloma\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of nipple discharge and the ultrasonographic findings of a dilated duct enclosing a well-defined solitary mass are most consistent with an intraductal papilloma. DCIS is a noninvasive cancer that is not associated with nipple discharge. Papillary carcinoma is a rare type of breast cancer that is not associated with nipple discharge. Fibroadenoma is a benign tumor that is not associated with nipple discharge. Fibrocystic changes are benign breast changes that are not associated with nipple discharge. \nThe best answer is C.
