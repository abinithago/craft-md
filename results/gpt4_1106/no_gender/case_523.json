{"case_vignette": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the physician with her mother because of a 1-week history of feeling unusually energetic. The mother describes her state as \u201chyper\u201d and reports that she often paces around her room. During this period, the patient has not slept. She had similar episodes 2 months and 5 months ago. The mother also states that, for the past 8 months, the patient has believed she is a famous singer and is going on a world tour next year. The patient does not have a partner and has only a few friends. She was working as a dental technician until 6 months ago, when she started to hear voices telling her to quit. She has not held a job since then. She does not use illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, her speech is pressured, but she suddenly stops talking in the middle of sentences and does not finish them. She occasionally directs her attention to empty corners in the room, as if she were listening to someone. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (Reproduced from a real case, with some details modified to protect the patient\u2019s identity.)\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The patient\u2019s delusions of grandeur, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and negative symptoms (such as social withdrawal) are all characteristic of schizophrenia. The patient\u2019s history of similar episodes in the past also supports this diagnosis. The patient\u2019s lack of sleep and hyperactivity are also consistent with the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The patient\u2019s lack of a partner and few friends may be related to her social withdrawal, which is a common symptom of schizophrenia. The patient\u2019s history of hearing voices telling her to quit her job is also consistent with the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The patient\u2019s physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities, which suggests that the patient\u2019s symptoms are not due to a medical or neurological condition. The patient\u2019s mental status examination shows pressured speech, which is a common symptom of schizophrenia. The patient\u2019s sudden stops in conversation and directing her attention to empty corners in the room are also consistent with the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The patient\u2019s lack of sleep and hyperactivity are also consistent with the patient\u2019s diagnosis of schizophrenia. The patient\u2019s history of similar episodes in the past also supports this diagnosis. The patient\u2019s lack of a partner and few friends may be related to her social withdrawal, which is a common symptom of schizophrenia", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Schizophrenia", "vignette_frq": "Schizophrenia", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor.
