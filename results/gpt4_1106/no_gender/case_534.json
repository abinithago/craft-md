{"case_vignette": "A 56-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of worsening pain in his left buttock. The pain is described as a deep, dull ache that is worse at night. He does not report any recent trauma. He has hyperlipidemia. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years and drinks one beer every night. He does not use illicit drugs. His only medication is simvastatin. Physical examination shows tenderness over the left gluteal region. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An x-ray of the pelvis shows a 4-cm, poorly defined, osteolytic lesion in the left ilium with a moth-eaten pattern of bone destruction, multiple well-defined sclerotic lesions, and an aggressive periosteal reaction. The remainder of the physical examination, including rectal examination, shows no abnormalities. Chest x-ray and abdominal ultrasonography show no abnormalities.
