{"case_vignette": "A 25 year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her boyfriend after she cut her forearms with a knife. She has had multiple visits to the emergency department in the past few months for self-inflicted wounds. She claims that her boyfriend is the worst person in the world. She and her boyfriend have broken up 20 times in the past 6 months. She says she cut herself not because she wants to kill herself; she feels alone and empty and wants her boyfriend to take care of her. Her boyfriend claims that she is prone to outbursts of physical aggression as well as mood swings. He says that these mood swings last a few hours and vary from states of exuberance and self-confidence to states of self-doubt and melancholy. On examination, the patient appears well-dressed and calm. She has normal speech, thought processes, and thought content. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Borderline Personality Disorder, B) Major Depressive Disorder, C) D) Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, E) None of the above.\nAnswer: A) Borderline Personality Disorder\nAnalysis: The patient's behavior of cutting herself and her history of multiple breakups with her boyfriend are indicative of Borderline Personality Disorder. The patient's mood swings, which vary from states of exuberance and self-confidence to states of self-doubt and melancholy, are also characteristic of this disorder. The patient's desire for her boyfriend to take care of her and her feelings of emptiness and loneliness are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's normal speech, thought processes, and thought content on examination suggest that she is not experiencing a psychotic episode, which would be more consistent with a diagnosis of Schizophrenia. The patient's history of self-inflicted wounds and her desire for her boyfriend to take care of her suggest that she is experiencing emotional dysregulation, which is a hallmark of Borderline Personality Disorder. The patient's boyfriend's description of her outbursts of physical aggression and mood swings also support this diagnosis.\nThe rewritten text would be:\nA 25 year-old individual is brought to the emergency department by their partner after they cut their forearms with a knife.
