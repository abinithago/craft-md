The patient is a nonsmoker and does not use any medications. The patient\u2019s family history is negative for any skin conditions. The patient\u2019s physical examination is notable for the presence of the 3 discrete, atrophic, blue-tinged plaques on her face. The patient\u2019s skin is otherwise normal.
