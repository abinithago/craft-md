{"case_vignette": "A 37-year-old primigravid woman at 36 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital 30 minutes after the onset of labor. On arrival, contractions occur every 8\u201310 minutes. During the last 2 days she has noted decreased fetal movements. The pregnancy had been complicated by gestational hypertension. Current medications include labetalol and a pregnancy multivitamin. Her temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse is 94/min, and blood pressure is 154/96 mm Hg. On pelvic examination, the cervix is 40% effaced and 2 cm dilated; the vertex is at -2 station. The uterus is consistent in size with a 30-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows the fetus in vertex position and a decreased amount of amniotic fluid. A fetal heart tracing is shown.
