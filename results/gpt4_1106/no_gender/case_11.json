{"case_vignette": "A 6-year-old Caucasian boy is brought to the clinic by his parents for dry, scaly skin that has persisted for the past 2 years despite the use of commercial moisturizers. His scaly skin is especially notable over his lower extremities, back, and elbows. The patient denies any pain over the affected areas and reports only a mild itch that is soothed with cold water or lotions. The parents report that he had a similar condition as an infant throughout his entire body and that he has siblings who also have persistently dry skin. His parents have tried exfoliating the scales with moderate success, but the scales recur shortly thereafter. The patient's medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and he has no known allergies. The patient's family history is significant for a history of eczema in his siblings and a history of asthma in his mother. The patient's physical examination reveals dry, scaly skin over the lower extremities, back, and elbows, with no signs of erythema, edema, or exudate. The patient's skin is otherwise normal. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results are unremarkable. The patient's diagnosis is atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema. The patient's treatment plan includes the use of topical corticosteroids, topical immunomodulators, and moisturizers to help manage his symptoms. The patient's parents are also advised to avoid using harsh soaps and to use gentle cleansers instead. The patient's parents are also advised to keep the patient's skin moisturized with regular applications of moisturizers. The patient's parents are also advised to avoid exposing the patient to allergens and irritants that may exacerbate the patient's symptoms.\n\nHere is the rewritten text with all gender-specific references removed:\nA 6-year-old child is brought to the clinic by their parents for dry, scaly skin that has persisted for the past 2 years despite the use of commercial moisturizers.
