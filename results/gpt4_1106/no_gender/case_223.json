{"case_vignette": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of increasing swelling of his legs and generalized fatigue for 1 month. During this period he has also had a productive cough and shortness of breath. He has been unable to carry out his daily activities. He has a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections and chronic nasal congestion since childhood. He has a 3-month history of foul-smelling and greasy stools. He is at 4th percentile for height and weight. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 23/min, and blood pressure is 104/64 mm Hg. Examination shows clubbing of his fingers and scoliosis. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. Jugular venous distention is present. Inspiratory crackles are heard in the thorax. Cardiac examination shows a loud S2. The abdomen is mildly distended and the liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Hepato-jugular reflux is present. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \n\nAnswer: The most likely diagnosis is cystic fibrosis. The patient's symptoms of chronic respiratory tract infections, clubbing of the fingers, and scoliosis are consistent with cystic fibrosis. The patient's history of foul-smelling and greasy stools is also consistent with cystic fibrosis, as the disease causes malabsorption of fats. The patient's edema and jugular venous distention suggest right-sided heart failure, which is a common complication of cystic fibrosis. The patient's liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin, which is consistent with hepatomegaly, which is also a common complication of cystic fibrosis.\n\nThe rewritten text is as follows:\n\nA 14-year-old patient is brought to the physician because of increasing swelling of their legs and generalized fatigue for 1 month.
