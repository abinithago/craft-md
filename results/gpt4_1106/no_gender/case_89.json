{"case_vignette": "A 70-year-old White man presents for evaluation of a recent foot injury. The patient states that he hit his foot at home and noticed blood on the floor; because of a previous injury, he was unable to view his sole. A large (several cm), irregularly shaped plaque is seen on the mid-anterior volar foot. The lesion is brown and black, with central red discoloration and overlying yellow-white scale. The patient reports that the lesion has been present for several months. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a previous injury to the foot. The patient is a nonsmoker and has a family history of cardiovascular disease. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits. The patient's physical examination is notable for a large, irregularly shaped plaque on the mid-anterior volar foot, as described above. The patient's skin is dry and rough, with multiple actinic keratoses on the face and hands. The patient's gait is normal, and he is able to bear weight on the affected foot. The patient's neurological examination is normal. The patient's laboratory results are within normal limits. The patient's radiographic studies are normal. The patient's diagnosis is a plantar wart, which is a benign growth on the foot caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The patient is advised to avoid walking barefoot and to use antifungal creams to prevent secondary infection. The patient is also advised to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor the lesion for signs of malignancy.\nHere is the rewritten text:\nA 70-year-old patient presents for evaluation of a recent foot injury.
