{"case_vignette": "A 5-year-old boy presents to the pediatrician office with complaints of multiple spots that began on the abdomen and spread to the arms and legs. The spots are not itchy or painful, unless he scratches them. Sometimes the skin surronding the lesion will become very red and painful, but then the lesion and redness fade. The parents report they have tried topical corticosteroids but the lesions do not go away. Mom endorses a history of atopic dermatitis in her sister and herself. Physical exam reveals multiple dome shaped skin colored to light pink papules with central umbilication and yellow core across the chest, abdomen, and back. The patient is otherwise healthy and has no other symptoms.\n\n## Step 1: Identify and replace gender-specific pronouns\nThe first step is to identify and replace gender-specific pronouns such as \"he,\" \"him,\" and \"his\" with more neutral pronouns like \"the patient,\" \"the child,\" or \"the individual.\" This will ensure that the text does not imply a specific gender.\n\n## Step 2: Replace gender-specific family relationships\nNext, replace gender-specific family relationships such as \"Mom\" with more neutral terms like \"the mother\" or simply \"the parent.\" This will maintain the accuracy of the information without introducing gender bias.\n\n## Step 3: Review the text for any other gender-specific language\nReview the text for any other language that may be gender-specific, such as \"boy\" or \"sister.\" Replace these terms with more neutral language, such as \"child\" or \"family member.\"\n\n## Step 4: Finalize the rewritten text\nAfter making the necessary changes, finalize the rewritten text to ensure that it is free from gender-specific language.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nA 5-year-old child presents to the pediatrician office with complaints of multiple spots that began on the abdomen and spread to the arms and legs.
