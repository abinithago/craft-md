I also removed the word \"he\" and replaced it with \"the individual\" to maintain a consistent subject-verb agreement. This rewritten text maintains the same meaning and clarity as the original text, but without any gender-specific references. \n\nAlternatively, you could use the pronoun \"they\" instead of \"the individual\" to make the text even more neutral.
