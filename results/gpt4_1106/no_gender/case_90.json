I also removed the word \"man\" from the original text, as it was not present. The rest of the text remained the same. \n\nIt's worth noting that using gender-neutral language can help to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for people of all genders. It can also help to avoid perpetuating stereotypes and biases. However, it's also important to be mindful of the context and the audience, as using overly formal or awkward language can be distracting or confusing. In this case, the rewritten text is a simple and straightforward revision of the original text. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the original text is a medical case study, and the use of gender-specific language may be more common in medical writing due to historical and cultural factors. However, using inclusive language is still an important consideration in medical writing, as it can help to create a more welcoming and respectful environment for patients and healthcare providers. \n\nIn general, using inclusive language can be achieved by:\n\n* Using", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Blastomycosis", "vignette_frq": "Squamous cell carcinoma.", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
