{"case_vignette": "A 24-year-old white female graduate student presents with erythematous, papulopustular patches of skin in a muzzle-like distribution surrounding the mouth, chin, and glabellar region. The lesions are tender to palpation, associated with a stinging and burning sensation, and are aggravated by exfoliating facial washes. Two-year treatment history includes a variety of topical antibiotics, azelaic acid cream, retinoid agents, benzoyl peroxide preparations, topical corticosteroids, and oral tetracycline for cyclic recurrences of outbreaks. These treatment methods were previously successful with complete resolution of each outbreak; however, at present the lesions are persisting despite treatment. The patient is otherwise healthy, with no significant medical history, and is not taking any medications.\nThe patient is a 24-year-old graduate student who presents with skin lesions in a specific distribution. The lesions are erythematous, papulopustular, and tender to palpation, with a stinging and burning sensation. They are located around the mouth, chin, and glabellar region, and are aggravated by exfoliating facial washes. The patient has a two-year history of treatment for these lesions, which have included topical antibiotics, azelaic acid cream, retinoid agents, benzoyl peroxide preparations, topical corticosteroids, and oral tetracycline. These treatments were previously successful, but the lesions are now persisting despite treatment. The patient is otherwise healthy and is not taking any medications.\nNote: The original text was written in a style typical of medical case presentations, which often include demographic information such as age, sex, and occupation. However, in a rewritten version, it is not necessary to include this information if it is not relevant to the patient's condition. In this case, the patient's age and occupation are relevant, but the sex is not. Therefore, the rewritten version includes the patient's age and occupation, but not their sex. The rewritten version also removes the word \"female\" to make the text more neutral. However, it is worth noting that the patient's sex is still implied by the use of the word \"glabellar region\", which is a term that is often used to describe the area between the eyebrows, a common location for acne in women. To make the text even more neutral, the rewritten version could use a more general term, such as \"the area between the eyebrows", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Perioral dermatitis", "vignette_frq": "Perioral dermatitis", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
