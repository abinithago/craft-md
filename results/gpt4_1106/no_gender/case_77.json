{"case_vignette": "A 64-year-old man with a history of numerous nonmelanoma skin cancers presents with a lesion on the left side of his nose that was first noticed about 6 months ago and is slowly growing. The lesion is not painful or itchy. The patient has not tried any medications on the lesion. The patient wears eyeglasses and the nose pad of his eyeglasses rubs on the lesion. On physical examination, an erythematous papule is found on the left superior nasal sidewall with a central depression. The patient is advised to avoid rubbing the lesion with his eyeglasses and to use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher. The patient is also advised to have a biopsy of the lesion to rule out a malignant melanoma.\nRewritten text:\nA 64-year-old patient with a history of numerous nonmelanoma skin cancers presents with a lesion on the left side of the nose that was first noticed about 6 months ago and is slowly growing.
