{"case_vignette": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of 2 episodes of screaming in the night over the past week. The parents report that their son woke up suddenly screaming, crying, and aggressively kicking his legs around both times. The episodes lasted several minutes and were accompanied by sweating and fast breathing. The parents state that they were unable to stop the episodes and that their son simply went back to sleep when the episodes were over. The patient cannot recall any details of these incidents. He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Sleepwalking, B) Sleep talking, C) Sleep terrors, D) E) None of the above.\nAnswer: C) Sleep terrors\nExplanation: Sleep terrors, also known as night terrors, are episodes of intense fear, anxiety, or panic that occur during deep sleep. They are most common in children between the ages of 3 and 12 years. The episodes are usually brief, lasting from a few minutes to 30 minutes, and are often accompanied by screaming, crying, and kicking. The child is usually unresponsive to the environment and is not able to recall the episode in the morning. Sleep terrors are often associated with sleep apnea, which is a common finding in this patient. Sleepwalking, or somnambulism, is a different disorder that involves walking or performing complex behaviors during deep sleep. Sleep talking, or somniloquy, is a disorder that involves talking during sleep. Neither of these disorders is consistent with the patient's symptoms. (Skill 1a)\nSkill 1a: Scientific Evidence Evaluation\nThis question requires the test-taker to evaluate the scientific evidence related to sleep disorders and to apply that knowledge to a specific case. The test-taker must be able to analyze the symptoms presented in the case and determine which diagnosis is most consistent with those symptoms. This requires an understanding of the characteristics of different sleep disorders, including sleep terrors, sleepwalking, and sleep talking. The test-taker must also be able to evaluate the relevance of the patient's history of obstructive sleep apnea to the diagnosis. This requires an understanding of the relationship between sleep apnea and sleep terrors. The test-taker must also be able to eliminate incorrect options based on the characteristics of each disorder.", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Sleep terror disorder", "vignette_frq": "C) Sleep terrors", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Pediatrics and Neonatology.
