{"case_vignette": "A 20-year-old college student comes to the physician because she has been extremely sad for the past 3 weeks and has to cry constantly. Three weeks ago, her boyfriend left her after they were together for 4 years. She has no appetite and has had a 2.3-kg (5.1-lb) weight loss. She has missed several classes because she could not stop crying or get out of bed. She thinks about her ex-boyfriend all the time. She says that she experienced similar symptoms for about 2 months after previous relationships ended. The patient is 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 45 kg (100 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.1\u00b0C (97\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination she appears sad and cries easily. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA. Major depressive disorder\nB. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\nC. Dysthymia\nD.  Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood\nE.  Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood with conduct disturbance\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms began after a significant life change (the end of a 4-year relationship). The symptoms are not severe enough to meet the criteria for major depressive disorder. The patient has experienced similar symptoms in the past after other relationships ended, which suggests that the symptoms are related to the stress of the situation rather than a chronic mood disorder. The patient's symptoms are not severe enough to meet the criteria for dysthymia. The patient's symptoms are not severe enough to meet the criteria for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood or adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood with conduct disturbance. The patient's symptoms are severe enough to meet the criteria for adjustment disorder with depressed mood. \nNote: The patient's symptoms are not severe enough to meet the criteria for major depressive disorder. The patient's symptoms are not severe enough to meet the criteria for dysthymia. The patient's symptoms are not severe enough to meet the criteria for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood or adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood with conduct disturbance. The patient's symptoms are severe enough to meet the criteria for adjustment disorder with depressed mood. \n\nThe rewritten text is as follows:\nA 20", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Adjustment disorder with depressed mood", "vignette_frq": "Adjustment disorder with depressed mood", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor.
