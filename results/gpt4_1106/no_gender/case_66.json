{"case_vignette": "A man, aged 42 years, presents with a 6-month history of a painful, scaly skin rash. The eruption is symmetrically distributed over photosensitive areas, affecting his face, neck, upper back, forearms, and hands. The dorsal surfaces of his hands and forearms exhibit a dusky brown coloration over rough and cracked skin. He complains of itching and burning and reports intermittent vomiting and diarrhea. He admits to heavy alcohol intake for the last 2 decades and denies taking any medications. Neuropsychiatric evaluation reveals short-term memory loss, speech problems, and poor concentration. His liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. His hemoglobin level is low, and his platelet count is decreased. He has a history of chronic hepatitis C infection. His physical examination reveals a jaundiced appearance, with scleral icterus and a palpable liver. His skin lesions are consistent with a diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). The patient's symptoms are likely related to his chronic hepatitis C infection and heavy alcohol intake.\nRewritten text:\nA person, aged 42 years, presents with a 6-month history of a painful, scaly skin rash.
