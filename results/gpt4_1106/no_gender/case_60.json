{"case_vignette": "A 25-year-old man with no remarkable past medical history presents with an itchy rash on the feet. Symptoms began 2 months ago, starting over the dorsal toes with redness, scaling, and itching. The eruption spread over the dorsum of the feet and progressed to weeping and crusting. He reports recently buying new shoes for work as a chef, which requires 15 hours daily of standing. Due to profuse sweating, his socks become soaked daily. Examination reveals symmetric erythematous plaques over the bilateral dorsum of both feet with fissures, scaling, and lichenification. No blisters or vesicles are present, but there are scattered crusted erosions. The patient is otherwise healthy and has no other symptoms.\nRewritten text:\nA 25-year-old person with no remarkable past medical history presents with an itchy rash on the feet.
