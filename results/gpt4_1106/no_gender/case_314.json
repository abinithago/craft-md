{"case_vignette": "A 9-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her father because of multiple episodes of staring and facial grimacing that have occurred over the past 3 weeks. There are no precipitating factors for these episodes and they last for several minutes. She does not respond to her family members during these episodes. One week ago, her brother witnessed an episode in which she woke up while sleeping, stared, and made hand gestures. She does not remember any of these episodes but does recall having a vague muddy taste in her mouth prior to the onset of these symptoms. After the episode, she feels lethargic and is confused. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Absence seizure B) Tonic-clonic seizure C) Myoclonic seizure D) Atypical absence seizure E) Complex partial seizure\n\n## Step 1: Identify the gender-specific references in the text.\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"9-year-old girl,\" \"her father,\" \"her brother,\" and \"she\" (used to refer to the girl).\n\n## Step 2: Rewrite the text to remove the gender-specific references.\nThe text should be rewritten to use neutral language that does not specify the patient's gender. For example, \"a 9-year-old child\" instead of \"a 9-year-old girl,\" and \"the child's parent\" instead of \"her father.\"\n\n## Step 3: Replace the gender-specific pronouns with neutral pronouns.\nThe text should be rewritten to use neutral pronouns such as \"they\" or \"the patient\" instead of \"she\" to refer to the child.\n\n## Step 4: Review the rewritten text to ensure that it is free of gender-specific references.\nThe rewritten text should be reviewed to ensure that it does not contain any language that implies a specific gender.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the most likely diagnosis based on the rewritten text.\nThe rewritten text describes a child who experiences episodes of staring and facial grimacing, does not respond to family members during these episodes, and has a vague muddy taste in their mouth prior to the onset of symptoms. The child also feels lethargic and confused after the episode. Based on this description, the most likely diagnosis is a complex partial seizure.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{E}$\n\nNote: The final answer is the same as the original answer, as the diagnosis is not affected by the removal", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Complex partial seizure", "vignette_frq": "Complex partial seizure", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Neurology.
