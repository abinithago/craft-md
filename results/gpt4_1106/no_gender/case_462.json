{"case_vignette": "A 13-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for the evaluation of progressive hair loss over the past 2 months. The parents report that they have noticed increased number of hairless patches on their daughter's head. The patient denies any itching. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. The patient states that she has been feeling tense since her boyfriend broke up with her. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She does not use illicit drugs. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows ill-defined patchy hair loss and hair of different lengths with no scaling or reddening of the scalp. Further examination shows poor hair growth of the eyebrows and eyelashes. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Alopecia areata\nB) Telogen effluvium\nC) D) Trichotillomania\nD) Trichorrhexis nodosa\nAnswer: A) Alopecia areata\nExplanation: \nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss. It is characterized by well-defined patches of hair loss. The patient in this case has ill-defined patchy hair loss and hair of different lengths, which is consistent with alopecia areata. The patient's history of stress, which may be related to the breakup with her boyfriend, is also consistent with alopecia areata. Telogen effluvium is a condition that causes excessive hair loss due to stress, but it is characterized by diffuse hair loss rather than patchy hair loss. Trichotillomania is a condition that causes hair loss due to compulsive pulling of one's hair, but it is not consistent with the patient's history. Trichorrhexis nodosa is a condition that causes hair breakage, but it is not consistent with the patient's history. \nThe best answer is A. \nNote: The original text contains several gender-specific references, including the use of the word \"girl\" to refer to the patient, and the mention of a boyfriend. These references have been removed in the rewritten text. \n\nHere is the rewritten text:\nA 13-year-old patient is brought to the physician by their parents for the evaluation of progressive hair loss over the past 2 months.
