{"case_vignette": "A 1-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of fever and crying while passing urine for 2 days. She was born at term and has been healthy since. Three months ago, she was treated for a urinary tract infection with oral cefixime. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F), pulse is 144/min, and blood pressure is 85/40 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Her leukocyte count is 14,000/mm3. Urine dipstick shows leukocyte esterase and nitrites; urinalysis shows WBCs and gram-negative rods. Urine culture results are pending. Renal ultrasonography shows hydronephrosis of the left kidney. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is initiated, following which the patient's symptoms improve. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? A) Perform a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) B) Perform a renal scintigraphy C) D) Perform a renal ultrasonography D) Perform a renal ultrasonography E) Perform a renal ultrasonography\nStep 1: Identify the gender-specific references in the text.\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references:\n- \"A 1-year-old girl\"\n- \"She was born at term and has been healthy since.\"\n- \"Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F), pulse is 144/min, and blood pressure is 85/40 mm Hg.\"\n- \"Her leukocyte count is 14,000/mm3.\"\n- \"Her urine dipstick shows leukocyte esterase and nitrites; urinalysis shows WBCs and gram-negative rods.\"\n- \"Her urine culture results are pending.\"\n- \"Renal ultrasonography shows hydronephrosis of the left kidney.\"\n- \"Empirical antimicrobial therapy is initiated, following which the patient's symptoms improve.\"\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the text to remove all gender-specific references.\nThe patient is a 1-year-old child brought to the physician because of fever and crying while passing urine for 2 days.
