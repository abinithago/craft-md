{"case_vignette": "A 79-year-old white man with an extensive history of nonmelanoma skin cancer presents for a routine skin examination. During his visit, he asks to have a groin rash checked. For 1 to 2 years, he has been using over-the-counter and prescription antifungal and antibiotic creams for a presumed \u201cjock itch.\u201d Recently, he has developed more discomfort and reports episodic, profuse bleeding from the area. Examination reveals a large erythematous, eroded plaque on the posterior right scrotum extending anteriorly to the right upper thigh. A nodule is present within the plaque. The left scrotum is minimally involved, and there is no adenopathy. The patient is afebrile. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of smoking. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history. The patient is a nonsmoker. The patient\u2019s family history is significant for a first-degree relative with lung cancer. The patient\u2019s social history is significant for a history of heavy alcohol use. The patient\u2019s medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, and aspirin. The patient\u2019s review of systems is significant for a 10-pound weight loss over the past 3 months. The patient\u2019s physical examination is significant for a 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm nodule on the right upper thigh. The patient\u2019s laboratory results are significant for a normal complete blood count, normal liver function tests, and a normal chest X-ray. The patient\u2019s diagnosis is a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, which is a type of nonmelanoma skin cancer. The patient\u2019s treatment plan includes Mohs surgery, which is a type of skin cancer surgery that involves removing the cancerous tissue layer by layer. The patient\u2019s prognosis is guarded due to the large size of the tumor and the patient\u2019s age. The patient\u2019s follow-up plan includes a 2-week follow-up appointment to check for any signs of recurrence.\nHere is the text with all gender-specific references removed:\nA 79-year-old person with an extensive history of nonmelanoma skin cancer presents for a routine skin examination.
