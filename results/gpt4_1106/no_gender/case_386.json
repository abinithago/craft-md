{"case_vignette": "A previously healthy 60-year-old man comes to his physician because of progressively worsening shortness of breath for the past 2 months. He does not experience shortness of breath at rest. He also occasionally has a dry cough. He has not had fever, chills, or night sweats. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He drinks a beer daily and occasionally more on weekends. He does not use illicit drugs. He is 183 cm (6 ft 0 in) tall and weighs 66 kg (145 lbs); BMI is 19.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg. Lung auscultation reveals a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%, an FEV1 of 60% of predicted, and a total lung capacity of 125% of predicted. The diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) is decreased. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \n\nThe patient's history and physical examination suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's history of smoking is a major risk factor for COPD. The patient's spirometry results show airflow limitation, which is a hallmark of COPD. The patient's decreased DLCO suggests that the patient has emphysema, a subtype of COPD. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and cough are consistent with COPD. The patient's physical examination findings of a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing are also consistent with COPD.\n\nNote: The patient's gender is not relevant to the diagnosis of COPD.\n\nAnswer: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specifically emphysema.\n\nHere is the rewritten text with all gender-specific references removed:\n\nA previously healthy 60-year-old person comes to their physician because of progressively worsening shortness of breath for the past 2 months.
