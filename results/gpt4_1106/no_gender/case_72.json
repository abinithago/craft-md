{"case_vignette": "A 65-year-old man presents with a recurring rash on his back. He has had the rash several times before, most often during the summer, and it was treated successfully with an antifungal shampoo prescribed by a prior dermatologist. The rash is not itchy or painful. He has a history of depression and hypertension. On physical examination, hyperpigmented macules coalescing into patches with very fine white scale are found. The lesions are scattered primarily on his upper chest and upper back. The patient is a nonsmoker and has a family history of hypertension. The patient's past medical history is significant for depression, hypertension, and a history of a rash that was treated with an antifungal shampoo. The patient's current medications include lisinopril and sertraline. The patient's social history is significant for a history of depression and a family history of hypertension.\n\nHere is the text with all gender-specific references removed:\nA 65-year-old person presents with a recurring rash on their back.
