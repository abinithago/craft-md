His past medical history is remarkable for multiple pulmonary cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax and renal cell carcinoma. He reports a positive family history of multiple renal cysts and recurrent pneumothorax. Physical examination reveals multiple light hypopigmented to skin colored dome shaped papules on the face and pedunculated hyperpigmented papules on the neck and axilla.  The patient is a non-smoker and has a history of sun exposure. The patient's family history of multiple renal cysts and recurrent pneumothorax is suggestive of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).
