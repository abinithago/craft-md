{"case_vignette": "A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because of tender, red nodules that appeared on his chest 3 days ago. Three weeks ago, he had similar symptoms in his right lower limb and another episode in his left foot; both episodes resolved spontaneously. He also has diarrhea and has had a poor appetite for 1 month. He has a history of dry cough and joint pain, for which he takes albuterol and aspirin as needed. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 15 years. He does not drink alcohol. Physical examination shows a linear, erythematous lesion on the right anterior chest wall, through which a cord-like structure can be palpated. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdomen is soft, nontender, and non-distended. Examination of the legs is normal. An ultrasound of the legs shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis of the underlying condition? \nA) Perform a biopsy of the skin lesion\nB) Perform a biopsy of the skin lesion and a bone marrow biopsy\nC) D) Perform a biopsy of the skin lesion and a CT scan of the chest\nD) Perform a biopsy of the skin lesion and a CT scan of the chest and a bone marrow biopsy\nE) Perform a CT scan of the chest and a bone marrow biopsy\nAnswer: C) D) Perform a biopsy of the skin lesion and a CT scan of the chest and a bone marrow biopsy\nThe best answer is D.  The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect any organ system. The patient's skin lesions, joint pain, and lung symptoms are consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient's history of smoking and poor appetite may also be relevant. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to perform a biopsy of the skin lesion to confirm the presence of granulomas, and to perform a CT scan of the chest to evaluate for pulmonary involvement. A bone marrow biopsy may also be helpful to evaluate for systemic involvement. \nNote: The patient's gender is not relevant to the diagnosis or management of sarcoidosis. The patient's symptoms and history are the key factors in determining the appropriate next step in diagnosis. \nThe best answer is D.
