{"case_vignette": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician because her mother is concerned about her lack of appetite and poor weight gain. She has had a 7-kg (15-lb) weight loss over the past 3 months. The patient states that she should try to lose more weight because she does not want to be overweight anymore. She maintains a diary of her daily calorie intake. Menarche was at the age of 13 years, and her last menstrual period was 3 months ago. She is on the high school track team. She is sexually active with 2 male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. She is at 50th percentile for height and below the 5th percentile for weight and BMI. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 58/min and blood pressure is 96/60 mm Hg. Examination shows fine hair over the trunk and extremities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Anorexia nervosa\nB) C) Bulimia nervosa\nC) D) Other eating disorder\nAnswer: A) Anorexia nervosa\nExplanation: The patient's weight loss, low BMI, and fine hair over the trunk and extremities are all consistent with anorexia nervosa. The patient's low body temperature and pulse are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of regular menstrual periods and her age of menarche are also consistent with anorexia nervosa.
