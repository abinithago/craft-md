{"case_vignette": "A 28-year-old healthy white woman with no significant past medical history presents with an enlarging papule on her right lateral neck. She describes a 1- to 2-mm pink papule that grew to approximately 10 mm within the past week. With minimal rubbing or trauma, the papule intermittently bleeds. It is otherwise nontender and nonpruritic. She has no history of skin cancer and is taking oral contraceptives. Physical examination shows a pink, friable papule on a stalk on the right lateral neck. There are no other similar lesions seen on examination. The patient is concerned about the possibility of skin cancer.\nThe rewritten text should be:\nA 28-year-old healthy individual with no significant past medical history presents with an enlarging papule on their right lateral neck. They describe a 1- to 2-mm pink papule that grew to approximately 10 mm within the past week. With minimal rubbing or trauma, the papule intermittently bleeds. It is otherwise nontender and nonpruritic. They have no history of skin cancer and are taking oral contraceptives. Physical examination shows a pink, friable papule on a stalk on the right lateral neck. There are no other similar lesions seen on examination. The patient is concerned about the possibility of skin cancer.\n\nNote: I removed the word \"woman\" and replaced it with \"individual\", and also removed the pronoun \"her\" and replaced it with \"they\". This is a common way to make text more inclusive and neutral. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some people may prefer to use more specific language to describe a patient's gender identity, such as \"non-binary individual\" or \"transgender individual\", depending on the context and the patient's self-identification. \n\nAlso, it's worth noting that the use of \"they\" as a singular pronoun is becoming more widely accepted, but some people may still prefer to use \"he\" or \"she\" as a singular pronoun. Ultimately, the choice of language should be guided by the patient's preferences and the context of the situation. \n\nIn this case, I used \"they\" as a singular pronoun because it is a common and widely accepted way to refer to individuals whose gender identity is not specified or is non-binary. However, if you are writing for a specific audience or context, you may want to use different language to be more inclusive and respectful.", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Pyogenic granuloma", "vignette_frq": "Pyogenic granuloma.", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
