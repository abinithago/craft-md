{"case_vignette": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He feels well. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation and weighed 2766 g (6 lb 2 oz). He now weighs 14 kg (31 lbs). There is no personal or family history of serious illness. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at 60th percentile for height and 55th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper left sternal border. S2 is widely split and does not vary with respiration. There is a grade 2/6 mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is no organomegaly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Ventricular septal defect\nB) C) Patent ductus arteriosus\nC) D) Atrial septal defect\nD) E) None of the above\nAnswer: C) D) Atrial septal defect\nExplanation: The presence of a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border and a grade 2/6 mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border is suggestive of an atrial septal defect. The murmur of an atrial septal defect is typically a systolic ejection murmur due to increased flow across the pulmonary valve. The mid-diastolic murmur is due to increased flow across the tricuspid valve. The murmur of a ventricular septal defect is typically a harsh holosystolic murmur. The murmur of a patent ductus arteriosus is typically a continuous murmur. \nThe best answer is C.  (Note: The original text has been modified to remove gender-specific references.
