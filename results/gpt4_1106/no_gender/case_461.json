{"case_vignette": "A 24-year-old male graduate student comes to the physician for a two-month history of repeated thoughts and anxiety that he is going to be harmed by someone on the street. The anxiety worsened after witnessing a pedestrian getting hit by a car two weeks ago. He says, \u201cThat was a warning sign.\u201d On his way to school, he now often leaves an hour earlier to take a detour and hide from people that he thinks might hurt him. He is burdened by his coursework and fears that his professors are meaning to fail him. He says his friends are concerned about him but that they do not understand because they were not present at the accident. The patient has no known history of psychiatric illness. On mental status exam, he is alert and oriented, and shows full range of affect. Thought processes and speech are organized. His memory and attention are within normal limits. He denies auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. Urine toxicology screening is negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? A) Generalized anxiety disorder B) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) C) Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) D) Panic disorder\nAnswer: B) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms began after witnessing a traumatic event, and he has developed avoidance behaviors (taking a detour to avoid people) and hypervigilance (leaving an hour earlier to go to school). These symptoms are characteristic of PTSD. The patient\u2019s anxiety and fear of being harmed are also consistent with PTSD. The patient\u2019s lack of a history of psychiatric illness and the absence of other symptoms such as hallucinations or disorganized thought processes make the other options less likely.\nThe following text has been rewritten to remove all gender-specific references:\nA 24-year-old graduate student comes to the physician for a two-month history of repeated thoughts and anxiety that he or she is going to be harmed by someone on the street.
