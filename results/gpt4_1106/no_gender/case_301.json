{"case_vignette": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of recurrent skin lesions. The episodes of lesions started at the age of 2 months and multiple treatment options have been attempted without success. He has also had several episodes of respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth. The boy attends daycare. His older brother has asthma. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 5th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. He appears ill. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Examination shows several raised, erythematous lesions of different sizes over the face, neck, groins, and extremities; some secrete pus. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes are enlarged bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \n\nAnswer: The most likely diagnosis is atopic dermatitis (eczema) with recurrent infections, which is suggestive of a primary immunodeficiency disorder. The patient's symptoms of recurrent skin lesions, respiratory tract infections, and enlarged lymph nodes are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's family history of asthma may also be relevant, as asthma is a common comorbidity with atopic dermatitis. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date, which makes vaccine-preventable infections less likely. The patient's low weight and length percentiles may be related to the patient's chronic illness. The patient's appearance of being ill and the presence of fever, tachycardia, and enlarged lymph nodes are also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nNote: The original text contains several gender-specific references, including the use of the pronoun \"he\" and the reference to the patient's \"brother\". To rewrite the text to remove these references, you can replace the pronoun \"he\" with a more neutral pronoun such as \"the patient\" or \"the child\", and replace the reference to the patient's \"brother\" with a more neutral reference such as \"a sibling\".
