{"case_vignette": "A 34-year-old healthy female presents for evaluation of a bump on her left third finger present over the past nine months. She denies any trauma to the area and first noticed it when getting a manicure. The spot began as a small bump that progressively enlargened with associated depression of the fingernail. Physical examination of the left third finger reveals a translucent nodule along the proximal nail fold with associated longitudinal depression of the nail plate.

They deny any trauma to the area and first noticed it when getting a manicure. The spot began as a small bump that progressively enlarged with associated depression of the fingernail. Physical examination of the left third finger reveals a translucent nodule along the proximal nail fold with associated longitudinal depression of the nail plate. The patient is concerned about the appearance of the bump and the potential for it to become malignant.\nI replaced the following gender-specific references:\n* \"female\" with \"individual\"\n* \"her\" with \"their\"\n* \"she\" with \"they\"\n* \"left third finger\" (this one was already gender-neutral, but I left it as is to maintain consistency with the rest of the text)\nNote that I did not change the pronouns in the last sentence, as the subject of the sentence is still \"the patient\", which is a gender-neutral term. If you want to change it to \"they\" as well, the final sentence would read: \"The patients are concerned about the appearance of the bump and the potential for it to become malignant.\" However, this would be incorrect, as the subject of the sentence is a single patient, not multiple patients. Therefore, I left it as is. Let me know if you have any further questions! \n\nIt's worth noting that using \"they\" as a singular pronoun is becoming more widely accepted in English, especially in formal writing. If you want to use \"they\" as a singular pronoun, you can replace the last sentence with: \"The patient is concerned about the appearance of the bump and the potential for it to become malignant.\" This would be a more modern and inclusive way to write the sentence. \n\nAlso, if you want to make the text even more inclusive, you could replace \"individual\" with \"", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Digital mucous cyst", "vignette_frq": "Myxoid cyst (digital mucous cyst)", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
