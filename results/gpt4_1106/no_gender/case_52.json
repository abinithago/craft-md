{"case_vignette": "A healthy 12-month-old infant girl presents with a yellowish-orange papule on the right upper extremity. Her mother first noticed this lesion approximately 6 months earlier. It has never bled, ulcerated, or formed blisters. The infant does not scratch the lesion nor appears otherwise bothered by it. However, when the lesion is rubbed, it appears to swell and turn bright red. On physical examination, there is a soft, oval-shaped, yellowish papule with a peripheral rim of erythema on the right extensor forearm. The lesion is approximately 1 cm in diameter. The infant's mother reports that the infant has been otherwise healthy and has had no recent illnesses. The infant's family history is unremarkable. The infant's physical examination is otherwise normal. The infant's mother is concerned that the infant may have a skin cancer, but the infant's pediatrician has reassured her that the lesion is likely benign.\nRewritten text:\nA healthy 12-month-old infant presents with a yellowish-orange papule on the right upper extremity.
