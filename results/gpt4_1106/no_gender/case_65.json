The patient's physical examination is notable for the presence of a 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm brown macule on his upper lip, a 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm brown macule on his lower lip, and multiple brown macules on his hands. The patient's nails are also notable for the presence of diffuse blue-black melanonychia with nail dystrophy on his toenails and longitudinal melanonychia with hyperpigmentation of the proximal nail beds on his fingernails. The patient's skin and nail findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, but the patient's lack of gastrointestinal symptoms and family history makes this diagnosis less likely. The patient's history of smoking and heavy drinking in the past, along with his current hypertension and hyperlipidemia, may be contributing factors to his skin and nail findings.\n\nRewritten text:\n\nAn elderly person presents with asymptomatic hyperpigmented, confluent, brown macules on their upper and lower lips, along with hyperpigmented macules on their hands.
