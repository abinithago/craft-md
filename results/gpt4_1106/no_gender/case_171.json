I also removed the word \"his\" and replaced it with \"the\" to make the text more neutral. I did not change the rest of the text as it does not contain any gender-specific language. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the text could be rewritten to be even more inclusive by using more neutral language throughout. For example, instead of saying \"the patient is a non-smoker\", it could say \"the patient does not smoke\". This would make the text more inclusive and respectful of patients who may identify as non-binary or gender non-conforming. \n\nHere is an example of how the text could be rewritten to be even more inclusive:\n\nA 34-year-old patient presents with a history of itching all over the body ongoing for the past year.
