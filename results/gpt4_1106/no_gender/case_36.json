{"case_vignette": "A 61-year-old woman presents concerned about a white discoloration on her left breast that she first noticed 6 months earlier. It itches at times, and she is worried it might be cancerous. She showed it to her gynecologist at her annual visit, and he referred her to the dermatology clinic. Physical examination of the left breast reveals a 10-cm white, smooth, porcelain-like plaque. There is no associated erythema and no noticeable scale. The patient is otherwise healthy, with no significant medical history. She is a nonsmoker and has no family history of cancer. The patient is concerned about the possibility of breast cancer, but the dermatologist is more concerned about the possibility of a benign condition such as a dermatosis or a fungal infection.\nRewritten text:\nA 61-year-old patient presents concerned about a white discoloration on their left breast that they first noticed 6 months earlier.
