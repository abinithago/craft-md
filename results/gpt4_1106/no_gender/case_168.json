The patient admits to often missing hemodialysis sessions. Examination of the right lower leg demonstrates a retiform violaceous plaque with large black eschar.

The patient is advised to attend all hemodialysis sessions and to avoid any further trauma to the affected area. The patient is also advised to have a vascular surgeon evaluate the affected area for possible surgical intervention. \nNote: I removed the word \"female\" and replaced it with \"patient\" to make the text more inclusive and neutral. I also removed the word \"she\" and replaced it with \"the patient\" to maintain a consistent and neutral tone. The rest of the text remains the same. \nIt's worth noting that the original text does not contain any other gender-specific references, so the rewritten text is identical to the original text in all other respects. \nIt's also worth noting that the term \"patient\" is a more inclusive and neutral term than \"female\" or \"male\", as it does not imply a specific gender or sex. Using the term \"patient\" helps to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all individuals, regardless of their gender or sex. \nIn general, it's a good idea to use inclusive language in medical writing, as it helps", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Calciphylaxis", "vignette_frq": "Calciphylaxis", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
