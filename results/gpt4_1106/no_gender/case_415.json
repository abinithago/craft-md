{"case_vignette": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has not had her menstrual period yet. At birth, she was found to have partial labial fusion and clitoromegaly. The mother reports that during the pregnancy she had noticed abnormal hair growth on her chin. The girl has severe acne. Three years ago, she broke her wrist after a minor trauma. Last year, she sustained a spinal compression fracture after lifting a box during a move. She currently takes oral isotretinoin and an oral contraceptive. The patient is at the 97th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows numerous inflamed pustules on her face and upper back. Breast development is at Tanner stage I. The patient refuses to have a pelvic examination. A pelvic ultrasound shows ovaries with multiple cysts and a normal uterus. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) B) Turner Syndrome C) Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) D) Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) E) Other\n## Step 1: Identify the key symptoms and findings\nThe patient is a 16-year-old girl who has not had her menstrual period yet, has partial labial fusion and clitoromegaly, severe acne, and a history of fractures (wrist and spinal compression). She is also taking oral isotretinoin and an oral contraceptive.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the symptoms and findings\nThe patient's symptoms and findings suggest a condition that affects the development of female secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development and menstrual cycle, and may also involve virilization (masculinization) and bone fragility.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the possible diagnoses\nBased on the symptoms and findings, we can consider the following possible diagnoses:\n- Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH): This condition is characterized by an excess of androgens, which can lead to virilization and bone fragility.\n- Turner Syndrome: This condition is characterized by a lack of estrogen, which can lead to delayed puberty and short stature.\n- Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS): This condition is characterized by a lack of response to androgens, which can lead to a female phenotype despite the presence of testes.\n- Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): This condition is", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia", "vignette_frq": "A) Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Endocrinology.
