{"case_vignette": "A 60-year-old man presents to the clinic with a 1-cm long horn-like projection coming from the skin on the superior aspect of the skull just lateral to midline. The structure is yellowish-white in color and feels very firm to the touch. He states that he noticed a small, hard lesion a few months ago and that it has grown progressively larger from the time of initial presentation to now. The patient denies any pain at rest but states that he experiences pain when the lesion is struck accidentally. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient is a nonsmoker and has a family history of osteoporosis. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits. The patient's physical examination reveals a firm, fixed, and immobile mass on the superior aspect of the skull. The patient's laboratory results are within normal limits. The patient's imaging studies reveal a bony growth that is consistent with a keratin-filled horn-like projection, which is characteristic of a keratin-filled horn-like projection, also known as a horn or horn-like projection.\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of a keratin-filled horn-like projection, also known as a horn or horn-like projection. The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia may be contributing factors to the development of this condition. The patient's family history of osteoporosis may also be a contributing factor. The patient's imaging studies are consistent with a diagnosis of a keratin-filled horn-like projection, also known as a horn or horn-like projection.\nThe patient will be referred to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment.
