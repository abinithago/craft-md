{"case_vignette": "A 22-year-old man comes to the emergency department for pain and swelling of his left knee one day after injuring it while playing soccer. While sprinting on the field, he slipped as he attempted to kick the ball and landed on the anterior aspect of his knee. He underwent an appendectomy at the age of 16 years. His vitals signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a swollen and tender left knee; range of motion is limited by pain. The tibial tuberosity shows tenderness to palpation. The left tibia is displaced posteriorly when force is applied to the proximal tibia after flexing the knee. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the left knee joint shows an avulsion fracture of the tibial condyle. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury\nB) Medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury\nC) D) Patellofemoral pain syndrome\nD) Patellar tendinitis\nE) Other\nThe correct answer is A) Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The patient's mechanism of injury, the presence of a swollen and tender knee, and the posterior displacement of the tibia when force is applied to the proximal tibia after flexing the knee are all consistent with an ACL injury. The avulsion fracture of the tibial condyle is also consistent with an ACL injury, as the ACL is attached to the tibial condyle. The patient's history of an appendectomy is not relevant to the diagnosis. \nNote: The patient's age and sex are not relevant to the diagnosis. The patient's sex is mentioned in the original text, but it is not relevant to the diagnosis and can be removed. The patient's age is mentioned, but it is not relevant to the diagnosis and can be removed.
