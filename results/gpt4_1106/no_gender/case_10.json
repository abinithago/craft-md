{"case_vignette": "A 20-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1 presents with ecchymosis and bullous lesions on his back, posterior legs, and buttocks. He was playing football when he ran into another player and became unconscious. He was immobile in the hospital for 3 days before he regained consciousness. He has about 7 tense blisters with areas of surrounding erythema on the back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. The blisters are not painful, but the surrounding skin is tender to the touch. The patient has a history of recurrent skin infections, including impetigo and folliculitis. The patient's blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, pulse is 80 beats per minute, and temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C). The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type 1, which is well-controlled with insulin therapy. The patient's family history is significant for a history of skin conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. The patient's physical examination reveals ecchymosis and bullous lesions on the back, buttocks, and posterior legs. The patient's laboratory results show a normal complete blood count, normal electrolyte levels, and normal liver function tests. The patient's skin lesions are consistent with a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid, a chronic autoimmune skin disease characterized by the formation of blisters. The patient's history of recurrent skin infections and family history of skin conditions may suggest a genetic predisposition to skin diseases. The patient's physical examination and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid.\n\nHere is the rewritten text with all gender-specific references removed:\nA 20-year-old individual with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1 presents with ecchymosis and bullous lesions on their back, posterior legs, and buttocks.
