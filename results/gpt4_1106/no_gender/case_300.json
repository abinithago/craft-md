{"case_vignette": "A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing shortness of breath and a non-productive cough for 2 months. She has been unable to perform her daily activities. She has had malaise and bilateral ankle pain during this period. She noticed her symptoms after returning from a vacation to Arizona. She is a research assistant at the university geology laboratory. She is originally from Nigeria and visits her family there twice a year; her last trip was 3 months ago. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Her left eye is notable for ciliary injection and photophobia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nThe patient's symptoms began after returning from a vacation to Arizona, which suggests that the patient may have contracted a disease that is endemic to the region. The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, and bilateral ankle pain, which are suggestive of a respiratory infection. The patient's eye symptoms, including ciliary injection and photophobia, are suggestive of conjunctivitis. The patient's complete blood count is within the reference range, which suggests that the patient does not have a severe infection. The x-ray of the chest shows a pattern of interstitial lung disease, which is consistent with a diagnosis of Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis). The patient's symptoms and the x-ray findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Valley fever, which is a fungal infection that is endemic to the southwestern United States, including Arizona. The patient's symptoms began after returning from a vacation to Arizona, which suggests that the patient may have contracted the disease while traveling in the region. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of Valley fever, which is a fungal infection that is caused by the Coccidioides immitis fungus.
