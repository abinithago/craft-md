{"case_vignette": "A 72-year-old man develops reduced urine output and a serum creatinine concentration of 2.9 mg/dL three days after being hospitalized for acute diverticulitis. On admission, a complete blood count showed a hemoglobin concentration of 15.5 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 14,000/mm3. Urinalysis showed 2+ proteinuria, and serum studies showed a blood glucose of 145 mg/dL and a creatinine concentration of 1.2 mg/dL. A CT scan of the abdomen confirmed the diagnosis. Therapy with intravenous ketoprofen, piperacillin, and tazobactam was begun, and the patient was placed on bowel rest. He has a history of hypertension, chronic constipation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin, metoprolol, and losartan. Today, his temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.9\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 135/87 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft on physical examination, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.
