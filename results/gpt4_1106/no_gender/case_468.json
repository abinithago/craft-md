{"case_vignette": "An 18-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her coach, 30 minutes after injuring her left knee while playing field hockey. She was tackled from the left side and has been unable to bear weight on her left leg since the accident. She fears the left knee may be unstable upon standing. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. The patient appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a swollen and tender left knee; range of motion is limited by pain. The medial joint line is tender to touch. The patient's hip is slightly flexed and abducted, and the knee is slightly flexed while the patient is in the supine position. Gentle valgus stress is applied across the left knee and medial joint laxity is noted. The remainder of the examination shows no further abnormalities.
