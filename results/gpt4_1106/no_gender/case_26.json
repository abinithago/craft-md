{"case_vignette": "A 13-year-old boy presents to the dermatology clinic concerned about the development of red, itchy, and sometimes painful bumps on his fingers. He first noted seeing the lesions 2 months prior, in early December. Although the initial lesions have since resolved, new lesions appeared after a skiing trip the previous weekend. The patient is otherwise healthy, with no significant past medical history, and he does not take any medications. Physical examination reveals erythematous, tender papules on the lateral and dorsal aspects of the distal fingers. The patient's mother reports that he has been using a new soap and shampoo in the past month, which he uses daily. The patient's family history is unremarkable, with no history of skin conditions or allergies. The patient's mother is a nurse, and she is concerned that the patient may have developed a skin condition related to his new soap and shampoo.\n\nRewritten text:\nA 13-year-old patient presents to the dermatology clinic concerned about the development of red, itchy, and sometimes painful bumps on their fingers.
