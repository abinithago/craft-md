{"case_vignette": "A 63-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of difficulty walking for the last 6 months. He reports weakness in his lower legs that improves with exercise and throughout the day. Three months ago, he started adding flax seeds to his breakfast because he is frequently constipated. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for the last 45 years. His current medications include enalapril and metformin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. Muscle strength in the lower extremities is decreased. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is normal. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. Active muscle contraction or repeated muscle tapping increases reflex activity. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? A) EMG, B) Nerve conduction studies, C) D) Nerve biopsy, E) None of the above.\n## Step 1: Identify the gender-specific references in the text.\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"A 63-year-old man\" and \"he\" and \"his\".\n\n## Step 2: Rewrite the text to remove the gender-specific references.\nThe text should be rewritten to use gender-neutral language. Instead of \"A 63-year-old man\", the text should say \"A 63-year-old patient\". Instead of \"he\" and \"his\", the text should use \"the patient\" or \"the individual\".\n\n## Step 3: Replace the gender-specific pronouns with gender-neutral pronouns.\nThe text should be rewritten to use gender-neutral pronouns such as \"the patient\" or \"the individual\" instead of \"he\" and \"his\".\n\n## Step 4: Review the rewritten text to ensure that it is free of gender-specific references.\nThe rewritten text should be reviewed to ensure that it is free of gender-specific references.\n\nThe final answer is: There is no final numerical answer to this problem. The problem requires rewriting a text to remove gender-specific references, which is a qualitative task. However, I can provide the rewritten text as the final answer.\n\nA 63-year-old patient comes to the physician for the evaluation of difficulty walking for the last 6 months.
