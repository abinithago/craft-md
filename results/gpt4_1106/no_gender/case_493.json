{"case_vignette": "A 74-year-old Hispanic man comes to the physician because of a three-week history of dizziness upon standing and a brief loss of consciousness one hour ago. The patient suddenly collapsed on his way to the bathroom after waking up in the morning. He did not sustain any injuries from his collapse. He has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and gout. The patient's mother died of a grand mal seizure at the age of 53 years. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 55 years. He drinks three beers and two glasses of whiskey daily. Current medications include ranitidine, dutasteride, tamsulosin, and allopurinol. He is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 62 kg (137 lb); BMI is 22.5 kg/m2. He appears pale. Temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg supine and 100/70 mm Hg one minute after standing with no change in pulse rate. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor. A plopping sound is heard on auscultation, immediately followed by a low-pitched, rumbling mid-diastolic murmur heard best at the apex. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows regular sinus rhythm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \n\nThe patient's symptoms of dizziness upon standing and a brief loss of consciousness are suggestive of orthostatic hypotension. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol use may contribute to his symptoms. The patient's physical examination shows signs of anemia, including conjunctival pallor. The patient's ECG shows regular sinus rhythm, which is normal. The patient's history of benign prostatic hyperplasia and gout may be contributing factors to his symptoms. The patient's family history of seizures may be relevant, but it is not directly related to his current symptoms. The patient's physical examination shows a heart murmur, which may be related to his symptoms. The patient's medications may be contributing to his symptoms, but the patient's history of smoking and alcohol use is more likely to be the cause of his symptoms. \n\nThe most likely diagnosis is orthostatic hypotension.
