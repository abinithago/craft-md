Urine toxicology screening is positive for cocaine, and laboratory findings include leukopenia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (70 mm/h). The patient is admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nNote: I removed the word \"woman\" and replaced it with \"patient\", which is a more neutral term. I also removed the pronoun \"she\" and replaced it with \"the patient\", which is a more neutral pronoun. This makes the text more inclusive and removes any potential bias towards a specific gender. \n\nIt's worth noting that the original text does not contain any overtly gender-specific language, but the use of the pronoun \"she\" and the word \"woman\" can be seen as subtly gender-specific. By removing these references, the text becomes more neutral and inclusive. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the text is a medical case report, and the use of gender-specific language is not necessarily intentional or biased. However, removing these references can make the text more accessible and inclusive for readers of all genders. \n\nIn general, it's a good practice to use neutral language in medical writing to avoid any potential bias or exclusion. This can be especially important in cases where the patient's gender is not", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Levamisole-induced antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody vasculitis", "vignette_frq": "Levamisole-adulterated cocaine-induced vasculitis.", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
