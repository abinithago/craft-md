{"case_vignette": "A 21-year-old male presents to the urgent care clinic after returning from the beach seven days ago. About three days ago, he noticed a red worm like rash on the bottom of his left foot that has been progressively moving. He reports walking barefoot on the beach. Examination reveals a serpiginous red-yellow plaque extending from left plantar forefoot to the medial aspect of dorsal foot.  The patient is otherwise healthy and has no significant past medical history.  The patient is a college student and is not on any medications.  The patient is concerned about the rash and wants to know if it is contagious.\n\n## Step 1: Identify gender-specific references in the text\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"21-year-old male\", \"he\", \"his\", \"the patient (male pronouns are implied)\".\n\n## Step 2: Replace gender-specific references with female equivalents\nReplace \"21-year-old male\" with \"21-year-old female\". Replace \"he\" with \"she\". Replace \"his\" with \"her\". Replace \"the patient (male pronouns are implied)\" with \"the patient (female pronouns are implied)\" or simply \"she\".\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the text with the replaced gender-specific references\nA 21-year-old female presents to the urgent care clinic after returning from the beach seven days ago. About three days ago, she noticed a red worm like rash on the bottom of her left foot that has been progressively moving. She reports walking barefoot on the beach. Examination reveals a serpiginous red-yellow plaque extending from left plantar forefoot to the medial aspect of dorsal foot.  The patient is otherwise healthy and has no significant past medical history.  The patient is a college student and is not on any medications.  The patient is concerned about the rash and wants to know if it is contagious.\n\n## Step 4: Review the rewritten text for accuracy and clarity\nThe rewritten text should be free of gender-specific references and maintain the original meaning and clarity.\n\nThe final answer is: There is no final numerical answer for this problem as it involves rewriting a text.
