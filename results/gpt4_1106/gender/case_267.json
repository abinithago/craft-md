His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 105/64 mm Hg. Examination shows normal muscle strength and 2+ deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. He has a broad-based gait and impaired tandem gait. Fundoscopy shows bilateral swelling of the optic disc. There is esotropia of the left eye. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Hypertension\nB) Hydrocephalus\nC) Diencephalic syndrome\nD) Diencephalic syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by a combination of symptoms including weight loss, irritability, and a prominent forehead. It is often associated with a brain tumor.\nE) Hypertension is a common cause of headache in children, but it is not typically associated with the other symptoms described.\nF) Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to increased intracranial pressure. It can cause symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances.\nG) The patient's symptoms are most consistent with hydrocephalus, which is a condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including a tumor or infection.\nH) The patient's symptoms are most consistent with hydrocephalus, which is a condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including a tumor or infection.\nI) The patient's symptoms are most consistent with hydrocephalus, which is a condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including a tumor or infection.\nJ) The patient's symptoms are most consistent with hydrocephalus, which is a condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including a tumor or infection.\nK) The patient's symptoms are most consistent with hydrocephalus, which is a condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including a tumor or infection.", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Medulloblastoma", "vignette_frq": "B) Hydrocephalus", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Neurology.
