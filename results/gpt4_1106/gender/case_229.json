{"case_vignette": "A 68-year-old man comes to the physician 3 months after noticing skin changes on his scalp. When he scrapes off the crust of the lesion, it reappears after a few days. Occasionally, his scalp itches or he notices a burning sensation. He had a mole removed on his right forearm 5 years ago. He is a retired winemaker. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows multiple rough patches on his scalp. A photograph is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Actinic keratosis\nB) C) Keratoacanthoma\nC) D) Squamous cell carcinoma\nD) E) Basal cell carcinoma\nAnswer: A) Actinic keratosis\nExplanation: Actinic keratosis is a common condition that results from chronic sun exposure. It is characterized by rough, scaly patches on sun-exposed areas, such as the scalp. The lesions are often asymptomatic, but they can be itchy or painful. Actinic keratosis is a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma, and it is often treated with topical medications or cryotherapy. The patient's history of sun exposure as a winemaker makes this diagnosis more likely. The photograph shows a rough, scaly patch on the scalp, which is consistent with actinic keratosis. The other options are less likely because keratoacanthoma is a rare, rapidly growing tumor that is often associated with a central crater, squamous cell carcinoma is a more aggressive tumor that is often associated with a history of sun exposure and a history of previous skin cancer, and basal cell carcinoma is a common, slow-growing tumor that is often associated with a history of sun exposure and a history of previous skin cancer. \nThe rewritten text is as follows:\nA 68-year-old woman comes to the physician 3 months after noticing skin changes on her scalp.
