{"case_vignette": "A 13-year-old girl presents with a cystic lesion that has been on her forearm for several years. Concerned about the lesion, she reports that it may have grown slightly larger in the past year and it is intermittently painful. More recently, a second similar lesion has appeared in close proximity. She denies any other suspicious lesions elsewhere on her skin. Her family history is negative for skin cancer, and she reports no other medical conditions. Physical examination reveals two well-defined 6-mm nodules that are rubbery, slightly tender, and pink on the right proximal ventral forearm. The overlying skin is intact, and there is no associated adenopathy. The patient is otherwise healthy and has no other symptoms. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes epidermoid cysts, keratoacanthomas, and basal cell carcinoma. The most likely diagnosis is a keratoacanthoma, given the patient's age, the location of the lesions, and the clinical presentation.\nThe rewritten text should be:\nA 13-year-old boy presents with a cystic lesion that has been on his forearm for several years.
