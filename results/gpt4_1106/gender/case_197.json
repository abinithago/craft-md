{"case_vignette": "A 35-year-old African American female presents for evaluation of a painless tongue growth present for the past three months. She denies biting the site or any inciting trauma. She noted it when brushing her teeth and it has slowly grown in size. Physical examination reveals a pink nodule on the right mid-tongue. An excisional biopsy is performed and reveals pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and collections of large polygonal cells with abundant cytoplasm and small cytoplasmic inclusions in the dermis.  The patient is diagnosed with a benign growth, specifically a fibroma. The patient is advised to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor the growth for any signs of malignancy.\n\nOriginal text:\nA 35-year-old African American male presents for evaluation of a painless tongue growth present for the past three months.
