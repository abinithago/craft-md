{"case_vignette": "A previously healthy 4-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents because she has not stopped crying for the past 5 hours. Her parents report that she has not eaten anything during this period and that they were unable to calm her down. She has not had any trauma. She was born at term via vaginal delivery and her delivery was uncomplicated. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a reddened and swollen 2nd toe of the left foot. A photograph of the left foot is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) 2nd degree burn\nB) 2nd degree burn\nC) 4th degree burn\nD) 4th degree burn\nE) 5th degree burn\nF) 5th degree burn\nG) 1st degree burn\nH) 1st degree burn\nAnswer: G) 1st degree burn\nThe correct answer is G) 1st degree burn. The child's symptoms are consistent with a 1st degree burn, which is a superficial burn that affects only the outermost layer of the skin. The child's toe is reddened and swollen, but there is no indication of deeper tissue damage. The other options are incorrect because they describe more severe burns that would likely result in more significant symptoms, such as blisters or charring. \n\nHere is the rewritten text with all gender-specific references swapped:\nA previously healthy 4-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because he has not stopped crying for the past 5 hours.
