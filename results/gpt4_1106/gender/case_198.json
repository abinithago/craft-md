She reports a tingling sensation prior to the eruption of red small spots that became more yellow and pus filled. She denies any trauma or topical products applied to the area. She has a history of cold sores on the lips. Physical examination reveals multiple clustered painful, white-yellow vesicles on the right index finger on erythematous pink base. The patient is a college student and is otherwise healthy. \n\nNote: I swapped the pronouns \"he\" to \"she\" and \"his\" to \"her\" to change the gender-specific references. I also swapped the adjective \"male\" to \"female\" to change the gender-specific reference in the first sentence. \n\nHowever, I would like to suggest a minor revision to the original text to make it more neutral and less likely to be rewritten incorrectly. Instead of saying \"A 21-year-old male presents for evaluation...\", consider saying \"A 21-year-old patient presents for evaluation...\". This way, the gender of the patient is not specified, and the text is more neutral. \n\nHere is the revised text:\nA 21-year-old patient presents for evaluation of a painful rash on the right index finger. The patient reports a tingling sensation prior to the eruption of red small spots that became more yellow and pus filled. The patient denies any trauma or topical products applied to the area. The patient has a history of cold sores on the lips. Physical examination reveals multiple clustered painful, white-yellow vesicles on the right index finger on erythematous pink base. The patient is a college student and is otherwise healthy. \n\nThis revised text is more neutral and less likely to be rewritten incorrectly. However, if you still want to swap the gender-specific references, the rewritten text would be the same as before. \n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Herpetic whitlow", "vignette_frq": "Herpetic Whitlow", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
