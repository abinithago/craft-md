{"case_vignette": "A 28-year-old healthy white woman with no significant past medical history presents with an enlarging papule on her right lateral neck. She describes a 1- to 2-mm pink papule that grew to approximately 10 mm within the past week. With minimal rubbing or trauma, the papule intermittently bleeds. It is otherwise nontender and nonpruritic. She has no history of skin cancer and is taking oral contraceptives. Physical examination shows a pink, friable papule on a stalk on the right lateral neck. There are no other similar lesions seen on examination. The patient is concerned about the possibility of skin cancer.\n\n## Step 1: Identify gender-specific references in the original text.\nThe original text contains the following gender-specific references: \"woman\" and the pronoun \"she\".\n\n## Step 2: Replace the gender-specific references with their female counterparts.\nTo swap the gender-specific references, we need to replace \"woman\" with \"man\" and \"she\" with \"he\".\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the text with the replaced gender-specific references.\nA 28-year-old healthy white man with no significant past medical history presents with an enlarging papule on his right lateral neck. He describes a 1- to 2-mm pink papule that grew to approximately 10 mm within the past week. With minimal rubbing or trauma, the papule intermittently bleeds. It is otherwise nontender and nonpruritic. He has no history of skin cancer and is taking oral contraceptives. Physical examination shows a pink, friable papule on a stalk on the right lateral neck. There are no other similar lesions seen on examination. The patient is concerned about the possibility of skin cancer.\n\n## Step 4: Review the rewritten text for any remaining gender-specific references.\nUpon reviewing the rewritten text, we can see that the pronoun \"he\" is still used, which is a gender-specific reference. To fully swap the gender-specific references, we should replace \"he\" with \"she\".\n\n## Step 5: Replace the remaining gender-specific reference with its female counterpart.\nThe rewritten text should now read: A 28-year-old healthy white man with no significant past medical history presents with an enlarging papule on her right lateral neck. She describes a 1- to 2-mm pink papule that grew to approximately 10 mm within the past week.
