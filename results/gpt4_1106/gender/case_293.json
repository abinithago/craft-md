{"case_vignette": "A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because of tender, red nodules that appeared on his chest 3 days ago. Three weeks ago, he had similar symptoms in his right lower limb and another episode in his left foot; both episodes resolved spontaneously. He also has diarrhea and has had a poor appetite for 1 month. He has a history of dry cough and joint pain, for which he takes albuterol and aspirin as needed. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 15 years. He does not drink alcohol. Physical examination shows a linear, erythematous lesion on the right anterior chest wall, through which a cord-like structure can be palpated. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdomen is soft, nontender, and non-distended. Examination of the legs is normal. An ultrasound of the legs shows no abnormalities.
