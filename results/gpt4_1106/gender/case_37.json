{"case_vignette": "A 56-year-old man presents with diffuse pruritic papules involving the upper body, with nose and forehead thickening. Over the past 2 years, he has been evaluated by multiple specialists for dysphagia, reflux, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and dyspnea on exertion. Examination results are significant for generalized firm, fleshy, dome-shaped papules of several millimeters in diameter, on his forehead, ears, neck, trunk, back, proximal upper extremities, and dorsal hands, with forehead, glabella, and nose induration. Relevant laboratory findings include monoclonal gammopathy on serum immunofixation, consisting of immunoglobulin (Ig) G_ and IgA_, and unremarkable thyroid panel findings. The patient has a history of smoking and hypertension. The patient's symptoms have been resistant to treatment with topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, and oral retinoids.\n\nRewritten text:\nA 56-year-old woman presents with diffuse pruritic papules involving the upper body, with nose and forehead thickening.
