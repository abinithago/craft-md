{"case_vignette": "A 50-year-old man comes to the emergency department for evaluation of right-sided facial weakness that he noticed after waking up. One month ago, he also experienced right-sided neck pain and headache that began after returning from a hunting trip to New Hampshire the week before. He took ibuprofen to relieve symptoms, which subsided a week later. He has a 5-year history of hypertension controlled with drug therapy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years and he drinks two beers daily. His vital signs are within the normal range. Physical examination shows right-sided drooping of the upper and lower half of the face. The patient has difficulties smiling and he is unable to close his right eye. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? \nA) Order a CT scan of the head\nB) Order an MRI of the head\nC) D) Order a lumbar puncture\nD) Order an EMG\nE) Order a blood test for Lyme disease\nAnswer: B) Order an MRI of the head\nThe best answer is B. The patient's symptoms of right-sided facial weakness, neck pain, and headache, especially after a recent trip to New Hampshire, raise the suspicion of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness that can cause facial weakness, neck pain, and headache. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to order an MRI of the head to rule out other causes of facial weakness, such as a stroke or a tumor. An MRI is more sensitive than a CT scan for detecting soft tissue abnormalities, such as those caused by Lyme disease. An EMG is used to diagnose muscle disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, and is not indicated in this case. A lumbar puncture is used to diagnose meningitis and is not indicated in this case. A blood test for Lyme disease is a good next step, but it should be done after an MRI of the head to rule out other causes of symptoms. \nNote: The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with Lyme disease, which is a tick-borne illness that can cause facial weakness, neck pain, and headache. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to order an MRI of the head to rule out other causes of facial weakness, such as a stroke or a tumor.
