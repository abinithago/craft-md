{"case_vignette": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the physician with her mother because of a 1-week history of feeling unusually energetic. The mother describes her state as \u201chyper\u201d and reports that she often paces around her room. During this period, the patient has not slept. She had similar episodes 2 months and 5 months ago. The mother also states that, for the past 8 months, the patient has believed she is a famous singer and is going on a world tour next year. The patient does not have a partner and has only a few friends. She was working as a dental technician until 6 months ago, when she started to hear voices telling her to quit. She has not held a job since then. She does not use illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, her speech is pressured, but she suddenly stops talking in the middle of sentences and does not finish them. She occasionally directs her attention to empty corners in the room, as if she were listening to someone. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Schizophrenia\nB) Schizophreniform disorder\nC) D) Bipolar disorder\nD) Schizoaffective disorder\nE) Other\nAnswer: A) Schizophrenia\nExplanation: The patient has a 1-year history of symptoms that include hallucinations (hearing voices), delusions (believing she is a famous singer), disorganized thinking (pressured speech and not finishing sentences), and social/occupational dysfunction (not working for 6 months). These symptoms have been present for more than 6 months, which is the criterion for a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The patient's mood symptoms (feeling \u201chyper\u201d and not sleeping) are secondary to her psychotic symptoms. Therefore, the diagnosis is schizophrenia, not schizoaffective disorder. The patient's symptoms have been present for more than 6 months, which rules out a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia disorder. Bipolar disorder is not the correct diagnosis because the patient's mood symptoms are secondary to her psychotic symptoms. The patient does not have a history of manic episodes, which is a criterion for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. \nThe best answer is A.  (Skill 1a)  The patient's symptoms have been present for more than 6 months, which is the criterion for a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
