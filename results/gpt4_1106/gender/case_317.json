{"case_vignette": "A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of stiffness and pain in multiple joints. She says that the fingers on both of her hands have become increasingly stiff and difficult to move over the past 8 months. She also complains of nails that break easily and look spotty as well as chronic back pain. She had a urinary tract infection a year ago that was treated with antibiotics. She is sexually active with 2 male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Her vitals are within normal limits. A photograph of her right hand is shown. There are multiple, well-demarcated red plaques with silvery-white scales over the shins and back. Serum studies show a negative rheumatoid factor and ANA. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Psoriasis\nB) C) Lupus\nC) D) Rheumatoid Arthritis\nD) E) Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome\nAnswer: A) Psoriasis\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of joint stiffness and pain, easy-to-break nails, and chronic back pain are suggestive of psoriasis. The presence of well-demarcated red plaques with silvery-white scales on the shins and back further supports this diagnosis. The negative rheumatoid factor and ANA make rheumatoid arthritis and lupus less likely. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. \nThe best answer is A. \nNote: The original text was written with a female patient, but the question and answer choices are not specific to gender. The question is asking for the most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms and test results, not the patient's gender. Therefore, the text can be rewritten by swapping all gender-specific references (male \u2194 female) without changing the meaning or the answer. \n\nHere is the rewritten text:\n\nA 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of stiffness and pain in multiple joints.
