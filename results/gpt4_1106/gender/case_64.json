{"case_vignette": "A man, aged 68 years, with no known history of atopy presents with a 4-month history of an itchy and burning rash on the legs that has been recurring every winter for the past 3 years. He notes that he had dry skin at baseline and did not use emollients, but he did try hydrocortisone 1% cream without improvement. Examination revealed ovoid, erythematous, well-marginated plaques on the lower legs and dorsal feet with variable scaling and focal weeping and crusting. There were no nail changes, and the rest of his skin examination was notable only for xerosis. The patient was diagnosed with chronic winter eczema, and a trial of topical pimecrolimus 1% cream was initiated.\n\nOriginal text:\nA man, aged 68 years, with no known history of atopy presents with a 4-month history of an itchy and burning rash on the legs that has been recurring every winter for the past 3 years.
