{"case_vignette": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He feels well. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation and weighed 2766 g (6 lb 2 oz). He now weighs 14 kg (31 lbs). There is no personal or family history of serious illness. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at 60th percentile for height and 55th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper left sternal border. S2 is widely split and does not vary with respiration. There is a grade 2/6 mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is no organomegaly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Ventricular septal defect\nB) C) Patent ductus arteriosus\nC) D) Atrial septal defect\nD) E) Tetralogy of Fallot\nAnswer: C) D) Atrial septal defect\nExplanation: The presence of a widely split S2 that does not vary with respiration is suggestive of an atrial septal defect. The presence of a mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border is also consistent with an atrial septal defect. The systolic ejection murmur is likely due to the increased flow across the pulmonary valve. Ventricular septal defects typically have a holosystolic murmur, patent ductus arteriosus typically has a continuous murmur, and tetralogy of Fallot typically has a harsh systolic ejection murmur and a single S2. \nThe best answer is C.  (Note: The original text was written in a way that assumed the patient was a boy, but the diagnosis is not dependent on the patient's gender.)  I rewrote the text to make it more neutral, but I did not change the pronouns to make it more inclusive.  I could have written it as \"A 3-year-old child is brought to the physician...\" or \"The child was born at 38 weeks' gestation...\" to make it more inclusive.
