{"case_vignette": "A 6-year-old Caucasian boy is brought to the clinic by his parents for dry, scaly skin that has persisted for the past 2 years despite the use of commercial moisturizers. His scaly skin is especially notable over his lower extremities, back, and elbows. The patient denies any pain over the affected areas and reports only a mild itch that is soothed with cold water or lotions. The parents report that he had a similar condition as an infant throughout his entire body and that he has siblings who also have persistently dry skin. His parents have tried exfoliating the scales with moderate success, but the scales recur shortly thereafter. The patient's medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and he has no known allergies. The patient's family history is significant for a history of eczema in his mother and a history of asthma in his father. The patient's physical examination reveals dry, scaly skin over the lower extremities, back, and elbows, with no signs of erythema or edema. The patient's skin is otherwise normal. The patient's laboratory results are unremarkable. The patient is diagnosed with atopic dermatitis, a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, itchy skin and a history of allergies. The patient is prescribed a topical corticosteroid cream to help manage the symptoms of atopic dermatitis.\n\nRewritten text:\nA 6-year-old Caucasian girl is brought to the clinic by her parents for dry, scaly skin that has persisted for the past 2 years despite the use of commercial moisturizers.
