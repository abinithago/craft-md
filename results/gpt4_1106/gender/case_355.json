{"case_vignette": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of 2 episodes of screaming in the night over the past week. The parents report that their son woke up suddenly screaming, crying, and aggressively kicking his legs around both times. The episodes lasted several minutes and were accompanied by sweating and fast breathing. The parents state that they were unable to stop the episodes and that their son simply went back to sleep when the episodes were over. The patient cannot recall any details of these incidents. He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Sleepwalking\nB)  Narcolepsy\nC)  Sleep apnea\nD)  Night terrors\nE)  Sleep paralysis\nAnswer: D)  Night terrors\nExplanation: Night terrors are episodes of intense fear or anxiety that occur during deep sleep. They are more common in children than in adults. The episodes are usually brief, lasting from a few minutes to 30 minutes, and the patient is not able to recall any details of the episode. The patient is usually not awakened by the episode and will simply go back to sleep. Sleepwalking, or somnambulism, is a disorder that occurs during the lighter stages of sleep. The patient is usually able to recall details of the episode and is often confused and disoriented. Narcolepsy is a disorder that is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden attacks of sleep. Sleep apnea is a disorder that is characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. Sleep paralysis is a disorder that is characterized by temporary paralysis of the muscles during sleep. \nThe best answer is D. (Skill 1a)  The question requires the test-taker to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms described. The correct answer is night terrors, which are episodes of intense fear or anxiety that occur during deep sleep. The other options are incorrect because they do not match the symptoms described. Sleepwalking occurs during the lighter stages of sleep, narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep apnea is characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep, and sleep paralysis is characterized by temporary paralysis of the muscles during sleep. \nThis question requires the test-taker to analyze the symptoms described and choose the most likely diagnosis.
