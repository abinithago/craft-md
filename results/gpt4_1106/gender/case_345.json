His mother reports that he complained of sudden nausea and seeing \u201cshiny lights,\u201d after which the corner of his mouth and then his face began twitching. Next, he let out a loud scream, dropped to the floor unconscious, and began to jerk his arms and legs as well for about two minutes. On the way to the hospital, the boy regained consciousness, but was confused and could not speak clearly for about five minutes. He had a fever and sore throat one week ago which improved after treatment with acetaminophen. He appears lethargic and cannot recall what happened during the episode. His vital signs are within normal limits. He is oriented to time, place, and person. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. There is muscular pain at attempts to elicit deep tendon reflexes. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Absence seizure B) Tonic-clonic seizure C) Myoclonic seizure D) Atypical absence seizure\n\n## Step 1: Identify the gender-specific references in the text.\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"boy,\" \"he,\" \"his,\" \"him,\" and \"his mother.\"\n\n## Step 2: Replace the gender-specific references with their female counterparts.\nTo swap the gender-specific references, we need to replace \"boy\" with \"girl,\" \"he\" with \"she,\" \"his\" with \"her,\" \"him\" with \"her,\" and \"his mother\" with \"her mother.\"\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the text with the replaced gender-specific references.\nA previously healthy 10-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after she had a seizure.
