The patient's mom reports the rash developed over the past two weeks and may be growing in size after having a few weeks of cold like symptoms. She denies any new topical products, fragrances, or dyes. She has not tried any treatments. Physical examination is remarkable for multiple pink flat topped scaly papules coalescing into plaques in a curvilinear distribution on the right posterior thigh and calf. Punch biopsy reveals a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, superficial perivascular inflammation and deeper lymphocytic perieccrine inflammation.
