{"case_vignette": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 10-day history of intermittent fevers and painful swelling of the right ankle. He has not had trauma to the ankle. He has a history of sickle cell disease and had an episode of dactylitis of his left index finger 3 years ago. Current medications include hydroxyurea and acetaminophen as needed for the ankle pain. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), blood pressure is 125/68 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 14/min. Examination shows a tender, swollen, and erythematous right ankle with point tenderness over the medial malleolus. X-ray of the right ankle demonstrates marked periosteal thickening and elevation, as well as a central sclerotic lesion with a lucent rim over the right lateral malleolus. A bone biopsy culture confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism? \nOriginal text:\nA 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 10-day history of intermittent fevers and painful swelling of the right ankle.
