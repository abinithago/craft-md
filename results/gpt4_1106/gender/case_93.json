(Note: The rewritten text is identical to the original text, as the changes were simply swapping the gender-specific references.) \n\nThis exercise demonstrates that the text is written in a way that is not specific to a particular gender, and the changes made were simply a matter of swapping the gender-specific pronouns. This is an example of how to make a text more inclusive and neutral by avoiding language that assumes a particular gender. \n\nIn a real-world scenario, this exercise would be useful for writers, editors, and healthcare professionals who want to ensure that their writing is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.
