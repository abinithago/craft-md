{"case_vignette": "A healthy 45-year-old woman presents with a several-month history of a small papule at the corner of her right eye. The lesion is asymptomatic and is not enlarging, but she has cosmetic concerns. She denies diplopia, vision loss, or any other lesions on her face and body. Examination reveals a dome-shaped, smooth, translucent papule filled with watery fluid located below the lateral canthus of her right eye. The patient is concerned about the appearance of the lesion and wants it to be removed.\n\n## Step 1: Identify gender-specific references in the text\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"woman,\" \"her,\" \"she,\" and \"her right eye\" (implied by the context, but not explicitly stated).\n\n## Step 2: Replace gender-specific references with gender-neutral or opposite-gender references\nReplace \"woman\" with \"man\" to maintain the same age and presentation for the sake of the exercise, but in a real-world scenario, this would depend on the actual patient's gender. Replace \"her\" with \"his\" and \"she\" with \"he\" to maintain consistency in the narrative. Replace \"her right eye\" with \"his right eye\" to maintain the same anatomical location.\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the text with the replaced references\nA healthy 45-year-old man presents with a several-month history of a small papule at the corner of his right eye. The lesion is asymptomatic and is not enlarging, but he has cosmetic concerns. He denies diplopia, vision loss, or any other lesions on his face and body.
