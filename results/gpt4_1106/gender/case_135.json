(Note: I swapped \"Mom\" to \"Dad\" and \"sister\" to \"brother\" to maintain consistency in the rewritten text.) \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the original text uses \"Mom\" and \"sister\" in a way that implies a female parent and a female sibling, but the text does not explicitly state the gender of the parent or sibling.
