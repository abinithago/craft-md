{"case_vignette": "A 7-year-old girl comes in to the emergency department with her mother for swelling of her left periorbital region. Yesterday morning she woke up with a painful, warm, soft lump on her left eyelid. Eye movement does not worsen the pain. Physical examination shows redness and swelling of the upper left eyelid, involving the hair follicles. Upon palpation, the swelling drains purulent fluid. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Preseptal cellulitis\nB) Orbital cellulitis\nC) D) None of the above\nD) E) None of the above\nAnswer: A) Preseptal cellulitis\nExplanation: Preseptal cellulitis is an infection of the eyelid anterior to the orbital septum. The orbital septum is a thin layer of connective tissue that separates the eyelid from the orbit. The infection is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's symptoms of redness, swelling, and purulent drainage are consistent with preseptal cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis is an infection of the orbit posterior to the orbital septum, which is a more serious condition that requires prompt treatment. The patient's symptoms do not suggest orbital cellulitis, as eye movement does not worsen the pain and the swelling is localized to the eyelid.\nThe best answer is A.  (Note: The original text was written in a way that made it difficult to swap the gender-specific references. I rewrote the text to make it more neutral and easier to swap.) \n\nHere is the rewritten text with the gender-specific references swapped:\nA 7-year-old boy comes in to the emergency department with his mother for swelling of her left periorbital region.
