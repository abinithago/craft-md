I've also kept the pronouns (she, her) consistent with the new gender. \n\nHowever, I would like to suggest a minor change to the text to make it more inclusive and neutral. Instead of using the pronouns \"she\" and \"her\", you could use the pronouns \"the patient\" or \"the individual\" to refer to the person. This would make the text more neutral and avoid any potential bias.
