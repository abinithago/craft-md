{"case_vignette": "A 60-year-old man presents with rapidly growing lesions on his face, trunk, axillae, flexural areas, and groin. The lesions appeared 3 months earlier in his perianal area and extended rapidly to other areas. Previously, he was treated with topical agents for atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis without improvement. Examination reveals disseminated violaceous papules and plaques on the face, trunk, axillae, and perianal area; some lesions were confluent and ulcerated. Yellowish-red to skin-colored papules are present on the scalp. He has no palpable lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient is a nonsmoker and has a history of alcohol use. The patient's family history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient's social history is significant for a history of alcohol use. The patient's physical examination is notable for a 10-year history of atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis. The patient's laboratory results are significant for a normal complete blood count, normal liver function tests, and normal lipid profile. The patient's diagnosis is a rare condition known as erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC). EAC is a rare skin condition characterized by the appearance of annular lesions that are typically violaceous in color. The lesions of EAC are often associated with systemic diseases, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient's symptoms are consistent with EAC, and the patient's medical history and physical examination are consistent with the diagnosis.\n\nRewritten text:\nA 60-year-old woman presents with rapidly growing lesions on her face, trunk, axillae, flexural areas, and groin.
