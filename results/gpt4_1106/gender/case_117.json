{"case_vignette": "A 40-year-old female presents with a recurrent skin eruption on her nose and cheeks for 2 years. These lesions appears usually in the summer following excessive sun exposure, and disappears without scarring. She has complains about arthritis and chronic fatigue. She denies muscle weakness. Physical exam reveals eroded butterfly-shaped erythematous plaques over the malar area, non-scarring alopecia and oral ulcers. The patient is a 40-year-old female who is a non-smoker and has a family history of autoimmune diseases. Her past medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The patient is on hydroxychloroquine and prednisone.\n\n## Step 1: Identify gender-specific references in the text\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"female\" (twice), \"her\" (multiple times), \"she\" (multiple times), and \"her\" in the context of physical exam findings (e.g., \"over the malar area\").\n\n## Step 2: Replace gender-specific references with their female counterparts\nReplace \"female\" with \"male\", \"her\" with \"his\", and \"she\" with \"he\". Additionally, replace \"malar area\" with \"malar area\" since it is a neutral term.\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the text with the replaced references\nA 40-year-old male presents with a recurrent skin eruption on his nose and cheeks for 2 years. These lesions appear usually in the summer following excessive sun exposure, and disappear without scarring. He complains about arthritis and chronic fatigue. He denies muscle weakness. Physical exam reveals eroded butterfly-shaped erythematous plaques over the malar area, non-scarring alopecia and oral ulcers. The patient is a 40-year-old male who is a non-smoker and has a family history of autoimmune diseases. His past medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The patient is on hydroxychloroquine and prednisone.\n\n## Step 4: Review the rewritten text for accuracy\nThe rewritten text accurately swaps all gender-specific references, maintaining the original meaning and content of the text.\n\nThe final answer is: There is no final numerical answer for this problem.
