{"case_vignette": "A 72-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife for memory issues over the last 7 months. The patient's wife feels that he has gradually become more forgetful. He commonly misplaces his car keys and forgets his children's names. He seems to have forgotten how to make dinner and sometimes serves uncooked noodles or raw meat. One night he parked his car in a neighbor's bushes and was found wandering the street. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD. Current medications include atorvastatin, metoprolol, ipratropium, and fluticasone. Vital signs are within normal limits. He is alert and oriented to person and place only. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. His Mini-Mental State Examination score is 19/30. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, liver function tests, vitamin B12 (cobalamin), and folate are within the reference range.
