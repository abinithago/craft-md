{"case_vignette": "A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of painless swelling in his left foot for 4 months. The swelling was initially accompanied by redness, which has since resolved. He has not had fever or chills. He has a history of coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has had 3 sexual partners over the past year and uses condoms inconsistently. His mother had rheumatoid arthritis. Current medications include clopidogrel, aspirin, metoprolol, losartan, atorvastatin, and insulin. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 95 kg (209 lb); BMI is 29 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiovascular examination shows no abnormalities. Examination of the feet shows swelling of the left ankle with collapse of the midfoot arch and prominent malleoli. There is no redness or warmth. There is a small, dry ulcer on the left plantar surface of the 2nd metatarsal. Monofilament testing shows decreased sensation along both feet up to the shins bilaterally. His gait is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Peripheral artery disease\nB) Diabetic neuropathy\nC) D) Peripheral neuropathy\nD) Diabetic foot ulcer\nE) Peripheral artery disease with neuropathy\nAnswer: B) Diabetic neuropathy\nThe correct answer is B) Diabetic neuropathy. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is a risk factor for diabetic neuropathy. The patient also has decreased sensation along both feet up to the shins bilaterally, which is consistent with diabetic neuropathy. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the presence of decreased sensation make diabetic neuropathy the most likely diagnosis. \n\nHere is the rewritten text with all gender-specific references swapped:\nA 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of painless swelling in her left foot for 4 months.
