{"case_vignette": "A 32-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of worsening shortness of breath and a productive cough for 3 days. He sustained trauma to the right hemithorax during a fight 3 weeks ago. He had significant pain and mild shortness of breath following the incident but did not seek medical care. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He is a construction worker. His temperature is 38.4\u00b0C (101.1\u00b0F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 120/75 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Pulmonary examination shows decreased breath sounds over the right lower lung fields. CT scan of the chest shows fractures of the right 7th and 8th ribs, right pleural splitting and thickening, and a dense fluid collection in the pleural space. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \n\nAnswer: Pneumothorax is unlikely because the patient has a productive cough and decreased breath sounds over the right lower lung fields. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of a hemothorax. The patient's history of trauma to the right hemithorax and the presence of a dense fluid collection in the pleural space on the CT scan are also consistent with this diagnosis. \n\nRewritten text:\nA 32-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of worsening shortness of breath and a productive cough for 3 days.
