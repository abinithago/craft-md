{"case_vignette": "A 35-year-old woman presents to the dermatology clinic with inflammation of her fingernails that first appeared 5 months ago and recently worsened. She reports wearing acrylic nails for the last year, removing them just before the clinic visit. On examination, the patient has erythema and swelling of the lateral nail folds and hyperpigmentation of the proximal nail folds of all fingers on her right hand. Examination also reveals nail dystrophy, onycholysis, and an absence of cuticles. She has not tried any treatments for this condition. The patient is a 35-year-old woman who is otherwise healthy and has no other medical conditions.\n\n## Step 1: Identify gender-specific references in the text.\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"woman,\" \"her,\" \"she,\" and \"her\" (again), which are all associated with the female gender.\n\n## Step 2: Replace the identified gender-specific references with their male counterparts.\nTo swap the gender-specific references, we need to replace \"woman\" with \"man,\" \"her\" with \"his,\" and \"she\" with \"he.\"\n\n## Step 3: Apply the replacements to the original text.\nHere is the text with the gender-specific references replaced: A 35-year-old man presents to the dermatology clinic with inflammation of his fingernails that first appeared 5 months ago and recently worsened. He reports wearing acrylic nails for the last year, removing them just before the clinic visit. On examination, the patient has erythema and swelling of the lateral nail folds and hyperpigmentation of the proximal nail folds of all fingers on his right hand. Examination also reveals nail dystrophy, onycholysis, and an absence of cuticles. He has not tried any treatments for this condition. The patient is a 35-year-old man who is otherwise healthy and has no other medical conditions.\n\n## Step 4: Review the rewritten text for accuracy and completeness.\nThe rewritten text accurately swaps the gender-specific references from female to male.\n\nThe final answer is: There is no final numerical answer for this problem, as it involves rewriting a text.
