{"case_vignette": "A 53-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of intermittent severe left neck, shoulder, and arm pain and paresthesias of the left hand. The pain radiates to the radial aspect of her left forearm, thumb, and index finger. She first noticed her symptoms after helping a friend set up a canopy tent. There is no family history of serious illness. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. When the patient extends and rotates her head to the left and downward pressure is applied, she reports paresthesias along the radial aspect of her left forearm and thumb. There is weakness when extending the left wrist against resistance. The brachioradialis reflex is 1+ on the left and 2+ on the right. The radial pulse is palpable bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Thoracic outlet syndrome\nB) Cervical radiculopathy\nC) D) Rotator cuff injury\nD) Thoracic outlet syndrome\nE) Other (please specify)\nAnswer: A) Thoracic outlet syndrome\nThe correct answer is A) Thoracic outlet syndrome. The patient's symptoms, including pain and paresthesias in the left arm and hand, are consistent with thoracic outlet syndrome, which is a condition in which the nerves and/or blood vessels in the thoracic outlet (the space between the neck and shoulder) are compressed. The patient's history of helping a friend set up a canopy tent, which involves repetitive overhead movements, is a common precipitating factor for thoracic outlet syndrome. The physical examination findings, including the patient's symptoms when extending and rotating her head to the left and downward pressure is applied, are also consistent with thoracic outlet syndrome. \n\nThe rewritten text with swapped gender-specific references is as follows:\n\nA 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of intermittent severe left neck, shoulder, and arm pain and paresthesias of the left hand.
