{"case_vignette": "A 2-month-old male infant presents with a rash in the diaper area. It has been present for the last month. He was seen by his pediatrician and was given topical triamcinolone as well as zinc oxide paste which did not help. His mom says that she was unable to make enough breastmilk and so has recently been feeding him from a new formula. Physical exam reveals erythematous erosions in the diaper area, as well as peri-oral scaling and a shiny tongue. There is no rash on the scalp. The pediatrician is concerned that the infant may have a condition called thrush, which is a fungal infection of the mouth and diaper area. The pediatrician orders a fungal culture to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n## Step 1: Identify gender-specific references in the original text.\nThe original text contains the following gender-specific references: \"male infant,\" \"his pediatrician,\" \"his mom,\" \"he,\" and \"him.\"\n\n## Step 2: Replace the identified gender-specific references with their female counterparts.\nTo swap the gender-specific references, we need to replace \"male infant\" with \"female infant,\" \"his pediatrician\" with \"her pediatrician,\" \"his mom\" with \"her mom,\" \"he\" with \"she,\" and \"him\" with \"her.\"\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the text with the replaced gender-specific references.\nA 2-month-old female infant presents with a rash in the diaper area.
