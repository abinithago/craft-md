{"case_vignette": "A 2-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of abdominal distention and twitching of her feet, which her mother noticed a week ago. The patient has also had a low-grade fever for 5 days. She has not had a bowel movement in 3 days. She was born at term and has been healthy since. She is at the 40th percentile for height and 20th percentile for weight. Her temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 128/min, and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. Examination shows an irregular palpable mass that crosses the midline of the abdomen. The liver is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin. There are erratic movements of the eyes. A 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid levels. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Neuroblastoma\nB) Wilm's tumor\nC) D) Pheochromocytoma\nD) Pheochromocytoma\nE) None of the above\nAnswer: A) Neuroblastoma\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with neuroblastoma. The abdominal mass, low-grade fever, and erratic eye movements are all suggestive of this diagnosis. The elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid levels in the urine are also consistent with neuroblastoma, as these are metabolites of catecholamines that are produced by the tumor. The patient's age and sex are also consistent with neuroblastoma, which is more common in young children and has a male predominance. However, the patient in this case is a girl, so the male predominance is not relevant.\nThe best answer is A.  (Note: The original text had a male pronoun, which was swapped to a female pronoun in the rewritten text.)  (Skill 1a)  The question requires the test-taker to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings. The correct answer is neuroblastoma, which is a type of cancer that affects the adrenal glands. The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal distention, twitching of the feet, and erratic eye movements, are all consistent with neuroblastoma.
