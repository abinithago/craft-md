{"case_vignette": "A 30 year old male is admitted to the hospital for a rash that developed on the chest and then spread across the back, face, and legs. He recently started lamotrigine two weeks ago for seizure prevention. He denies any other recent medication changes. He endorses significant pain at the site of the rash and also pain with urination.   Physical examination reveals diffuse pink erythematous patches of the chest, back with few scattered dusky central patches and multiple bullae. Applying pressure with a finger and moving laterally results in separation of the skin on many areas of the back. Oral erosions on the lips and on the glans penis are appreciated.   The patient is diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The patient is transferred to the burn unit for further care.\n\nRewritten text:\nA 30 year old female is admitted to the hospital for a rash that developed on the chest and then spread across the back, face, and legs.
