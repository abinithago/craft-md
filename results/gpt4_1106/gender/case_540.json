{"case_vignette": "A 17-year-old girl comes to the emergency department with a 5-day history of severe abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting. She also has pain with urination. She is sexually active with one male partner, and they use condoms inconsistently. She experienced a burning pain when she last had sexual intercourse 3 days ago. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 days. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness in the lower quadrants. Pelvic examination shows cervical motion tenderness and purulent cervical discharge. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 15,000/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 100 mm/h. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\nB) Appendicitis\nC) D) Ectopic pregnancy\nD) Ovarian torsion\nE) Other\n\nAnswer: A) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, vomiting, and pain with urination, along with the pelvic examination findings of cervical motion tenderness and purulent cervical discharge, are consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the female reproductive organs, often caused by sexually transmitted bacteria. The patient's history of inconsistent condom use and recent painful sexual intercourse also support this diagnosis. The patient's laboratory studies show an elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, indicating an inflammatory process. The patient's regular menstrual cycle and lack of other symptoms make ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, and appendicitis less likely. \nNote: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with PID, but the diagnosis should be confirmed with laboratory tests, such as a urine pregnancy test, a urine or blood culture, and imaging studies, such as an ultrasound. \nThe best answer is A.
