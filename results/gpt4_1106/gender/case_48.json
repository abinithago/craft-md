{"case_vignette": "A 62-year-old man with well-controlled rosacea, a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; stable on no current therapy) was seen in the clinic for a full-body skin check. Results of his examination were unremarkable except for the presence of periorbital, yellow-brown plaques with violaceous borders involving the upper and lower eyelids, bilaterally. There was induration, but no warmth or tenderness, of the periorbital plaques. He first noticed these lesions around the time he was diagnosed with CLL; initially they were more discrete yellow papules that developed into plaques over time. They are completely asymptomatic. The patient has been on a regimen of topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus for the least 6 months, but the lesions have not responded to treatment. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and is a current smoker. The patient's family history is significant for a mother with CLL and a father with a history of lung cancer.\nRewritten text:\nA 62-year-old woman with well-controlled rosacea, a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; stable on no current therapy) was seen in the clinic for a full-body skin check.
