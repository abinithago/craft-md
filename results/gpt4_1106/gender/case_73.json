{"case_vignette": "A 22-year-old woman presents for evaluation of progressive skin changes on her neck and arms beginning sometime around puberty. She tried various over-the-counter anti-itch, antiaging, and eczema creams that were ineffective. She has no personal or family history of skin conditions and is otherwise healthy. Review of systems is negative for skin laxity, joint hypermobility, or vision changes. Physical examination reveals numerous nontender, noninflammatory, yellow, 2- to 5-mm papules that coalesce into reticulated plaques on the nape of her neck and bilateral antecubital fossa. A punch biopsy demonstrates fragmentation and calcification of elastic fibers. The patient is diagnosed with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin, eye, and cardiovascular manifestations.\n\nOriginal text:\nA 22-year-old man presents for evaluation of progressive skin changes on his neck and arms beginning sometime around puberty.
