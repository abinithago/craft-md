{"case_vignette": "A 24-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 33 weeks\u2019 gestation, is admitted to the hospital for treatment of preterm labor. She has no history of serious illness and her only medication is a multivitamin. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg. Therapy with nifedipine and betamethasone is begun. The patient continues to have contractions; nifedipine is discontinued and treatment with high-dose terbutaline is initiated. Her contractions resolve. Three hours later, the patient reports fatigue and weakness. Neurologic examination shows proximal muscle weakness of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? \nA) Elevated serum creatine kinase\nB) C) Elevated serum potassium\nC) D) Elevated serum potassium\nD) Elevated serum potassium\nE) Elevated serum potassium\nF) Elevated serum potassium\nAnswer: A) Elevated serum creatine kinase\nExplanation: The patient is experiencing a side effect of terbutaline, which is a beta-2 agonist. Beta-2 agonists can cause rhabdomyolysis, which is a condition in which muscle tissue breaks down. This can lead to elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. Elevated serum potassium levels can also occur, but this is not the most specific indicator of rhabdomyolysis. The other options are incorrect because they are not related to the side effect of terbutaline. \nThe best answer is A.
