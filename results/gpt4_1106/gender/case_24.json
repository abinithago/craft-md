The patient has a history of prematurity and low birthweight but is otherwise healthy. The patient has no relevant social or family history. The patient\u2019s mother is a 30-year-old woman who is otherwise healthy. The patient\u2019s father is a 35-year-old man who is also otherwise healthy. The patient\u2019s mother is concerned that the hair loss may be related to the patient\u2019s prematurity and low birthweight. The patient\u2019s mother is also concerned that the hair loss may be a sign of a genetic disorder. The patient\u2019s mother is worried that the patient may have a condition that is passed down from the patient\u2019s father.\n\nOriginal text:\nA 1-year-old boy presents with a single, L-shaped, yellow-orange hairless patch over the left preauricular skin.
