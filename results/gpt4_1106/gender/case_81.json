{"case_vignette": "A 15-year-old girl presents with patches of hair loss on her scalp that have been present for the last 6 months. She reports that her scalp is not itchy or painful and denies any recent illnesses, diet changes, or stressful life events. She does not have any other medical conditions and takes no medications. Her uncle had a similar condition that started when he was in his 20s, but no one else in the family has experienced hair loss. The patient says she has not tried any treatments for the condition. On examination, she has several well-demarcated patches of hair loss on her frontal and parietal scalp, with no perifollicular erythema or scale. The patient's hair loss is consistent with alopecia areata, a condition characterized by patchy hair loss due to an autoimmune response.\n\nOriginal text:\nA 15-year-old girl presents with patches of hair loss on her scalp that have been present for the last 6 months.
