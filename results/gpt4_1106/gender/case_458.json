{"case_vignette": "An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because he has excessively dry skin. His mother says that he has had dry, scaly skin since he was 6 months old. She says it is worse in winter and better in summer. There is no associated itching, redness, or discharge. Examination reveals generalized fine scales with coarse skin all over the body, except in the skin creases of the neck and in the cubital and popliteal fossae (see image). There are multiple papular elevations at the base of hair follicles and darkening of the palmar and plantar creases.  A) Eczema B) Psoriasis C) Seborrheic dermatitis D) Keratosis pilaris\nAnswer: D) Keratosis pilaris\nExplanation: Keratosis pilaris is a benign condition characterized by the appearance of small, rough, sandpapery papules on the skin, especially on the arms and legs. It is caused by the accumulation of keratin in the hair follicles. The condition is more common in children and is often associated with dry skin. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with keratosis pilaris. Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by itchy, red, and scaly skin. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition characterized by thick, scaly skin. Seborrheic dermatitis is a condition characterized by a red, itchy, and scaly rash, often on the scalp, face, and torso. None of these conditions match the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\nThe rewritten text is as follows:\nAn 8-year-old girl is brought to the physician because she has excessively dry skin.
