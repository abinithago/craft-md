{"case_vignette": "A 53-year-old man presents to the clinic with ulcerated, scarred, and hypertrophic plaques on both lower extremities. He is a refugee from Sudan who arrived in the United States a month earlier. He reports that the lesions started as red bumps that slowly expanded and developed a raised border. Several of his family members in Sudan have had similar lesions in the past, and he is concerned that he may have developed the same condition. The patient is a non-smoker and has no history of skin cancer. He has a history of hypertension and is on medication for it. The patient is concerned that the lesions may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition.\n\n## Step 1: Identify gender-specific references in the text\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"man,\" \"he,\" \"his,\" and \"him.\" These words are all masculine and need to be replaced with feminine references.\n\n## Step 2: Replace gender-specific references with feminine alternatives\nTo swap the gender-specific references, we need to replace \"man\" with \"woman,\" \"he\" with \"she,\" \"his\" with \"her,\" and \"him\" with \"her.\"\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the text with the replaced gender-specific references\nHere is the rewritten text with the replaced gender-specific references:\n\nA 53-year-old woman presents to the clinic with ulcerated, scarred, and hypertrophic plaques on both lower extremities.

The patient is a non-smoker and has no history of skin cancer. She has a history of hypertension and is on medication for it. The patient is concerned that the lesions may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition.\n\n## Step 4: Review the rewritten text for accuracy\nThe rewritten text should be reviewed to ensure that all gender-specific references have been replaced correctly and that the text still conveys the same meaning as the original.\n\nThe final answer is: There is no final numerical answer for this problem, as it involves rewriting a text to swap gender-specific references.
