The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with lichen sclerosus, a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects the genital area. Lichen sclerosus is more common in women, but it can also occur in men. The condition is characterized by white, atrophic papules and erythema of the affected skin, as well as narrowing and sclerosis of the urinary meatus. A biopsy of the affected skin and urinary meatus is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. \nNote: The question and answer choices are written in a way that is neutral with respect to gender, but the correct answer is based on the fact that lichen sclerosus is more common in women. \nHere is the text with all gender-specific references swapped:\nA sexually active 37-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 7-day history of itching in the area of her genitals.
