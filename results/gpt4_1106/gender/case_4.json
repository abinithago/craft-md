{"case_vignette": "A 20-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a circular hypopigmented lesion on her right cheek. The patient stated that she used to have a mole in the same location. Over time she noticed a white area around the mole that enlarged to the current size of the lesion. After a few months she noticed the mole in the center of the lesion had disappeared. On further questioning, she denies any personal or family history of skin cancer. The patient is a non-smoker and has no history of sunburns. She has a history of using sunscreen daily. The patient is concerned about the possibility of skin cancer. The physician orders a biopsy of the lesion to rule out skin cancer.\n\n## Step 1: Identify gender-specific references in the text.\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"woman,\" \"her,\" \"she,\" \"patient\" (which is typically used to refer to a female patient in medical contexts), and \"her\" again.\n\n## Step 2: Replace the identified gender-specific references with their female-to-male counterparts.\nReplace \"woman\" with \"man,\" \"her\" with \"his,\" \"she\" with \"he,\" and \"patient\" (when referring to a female) with \"patient\" (neutral) or \"he\" (when referring to a male patient).\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the text with the replaced references.\nA 20-year-old man presents to the clinic with a circular hypopigmented lesion on his right cheek. The patient stated that he used to have a mole in the same location. Over time he noticed a white area around the mole that enlarged to the current size of the lesion. After a few months he noticed the mole in the center of the lesion had disappeared. On further questioning, he denies any personal or family history of skin cancer. The patient is a non-smoker and has no history of sunburns. He has a history of using sunscreen daily. The patient is concerned about the possibility of skin cancer. The physician orders a biopsy of the lesion to rule out skin cancer.\n\n## Step 4: Review the rewritten text for any remaining gender-specific references.\nThe rewritten text should be free of gender-specific references, but it's essential to ensure that the language used is neutral and applicable to both genders.\n\nThe final answer is: There is no final numerical answer for this problem as it involves rewriting a text to make it gender-neutral.
