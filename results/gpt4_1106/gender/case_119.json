{"case_vignette": "A 5-year-old female presents with a plaque on her left leg. The lesion appeared a few months after her birth. It has been increasing in size proportionally to her growth. The parents mentions that the skin lesion sometimes becomes irritated, erythematous and itchy when the patient plays with it or when she gets sick. Physical exam reveals a red-brown well delimited plaque on her left leg without any noticeable erythema or epidermal changes. The patient is otherwise healthy and has no other symptoms. The parents are concerned about the possibility of a skin cancer. The doctor orders a biopsy to rule out skin cancer and other possible causes.\n\n## Step 1: Identify gender-specific references in the text.\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"A 5-year-old female,\" \"her,\" \"she,\" \"her left leg,\" \"her birth,\" \"her growth,\" \"the patient (which is a female pronoun),\" \"her left leg,\" \"she,\" \"her,\" \"the patient (again, a female pronoun),\" \"her,\" \"she,\" \"her left leg,\" \"she,\" \"her,\" \"the patient (again, a female pronoun).\"\n\n## Step 2: Replace the gender-specific references with their male counterparts.\nReplace \"female\" with \"male,\" \"her\" with \"his,\" \"she\" with \"he,\" \"her left leg\" with \"his left leg,\" \"her birth\" with \"his birth,\" \"her growth\" with \"his growth,\" and \"the patient\" with \"the patient (no change needed since it's a neutral term).\"\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the text with the replaced references.\nA 5-year-old male presents with a plaque on his left leg. The lesion appeared a few months after his birth. It has been increasing in size proportionally to his growth. The parents mention that the skin lesion sometimes becomes irritated, erythematous and itchy when the patient plays with it or when he gets sick. Physical exam reveals a red-brown well delimited plaque on his left leg without any noticeable erythema or epidermal changes. The patient is otherwise healthy and has no other symptoms. The parents are concerned about the possibility of a skin cancer.
