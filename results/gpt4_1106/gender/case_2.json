Her medical and family histories are otherwise unremarkable. Her father states that when the macules and papules go away, the skin where the lesions were previously located is typically lighter than before. The child has been treated with topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines, but the lesions have persisted. The child's father is concerned that the child may have a condition that is not being properly diagnosed. (Note: I swapped the gender of the child, the parent, and the pronouns used to refer to them, as well as the parent's relationship to the child.) \n\nHowever, the rewritten text still uses the pronoun \"her\" to refer to the child, which is a bit inconsistent with the rest of the text. A more consistent version would be:\n\nAn 8-year-old female child is brought to the clinic for the third time in 4 months presenting with red-brown papules", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta", "vignette_frq": "Pityriasis lichenoides chronica", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
