{"case_vignette": "A 77-year-old woman is brought to the physician for gradually increasing confusion and difficulty walking for the past 4 months. Her daughter is concerned because she has been forgetful and seems to be walking more slowly. She has been distracted during her weekly bridge games and her usual television shows. She has also had increasingly frequent episodes of urinary incontinence and now wears an adult diaper daily. She has hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Current medications include lisinopril and atorvastatin. Her temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 139/83 mmHg. She is confused and oriented only to person and place. She recalls 2 out of 3 words immediately and 1 out of 3 after five minutes. She has a broad-based gait and takes short steps. Sensation is intact and muscle strength is 5/5 throughout. Laboratory studies are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? \nA) Normal pressure hydrocephalus\nB) Normal pressure hydrocephalus with dementia\nC) Dementia\nD)  Normal pressure hydrocephalus with dementia and parkinsonism\nE)  Normal pressure hydrocephalus with dementia and parkinsonism and depression\nAnswer: A) Normal pressure hydrocephalus\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia are classic for normal pressure hydrocephalus. The patient's broad-based gait and short steps are indicative of a gait disturbance, and her urinary incontinence is a common symptom of normal pressure hydrocephalus. Her dementia is also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's normal laboratory studies and lack of other symptoms make the other options less likely. \nThe best answer is A. \nRewritten text:\nA 77-year-old man is brought to the physician for gradually increasing confusion and difficulty walking for the past 4 months.
