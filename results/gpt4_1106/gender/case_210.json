{"case_vignette": "A 20-year-old college student comes to the physician because she has been extremely sad for the past 3 weeks and has to cry constantly. Three weeks ago, her boyfriend left her after they were together for 4 years. She has no appetite and has had a 2.3-kg (5.1-lb) weight loss. She has missed several classes because she could not stop crying or get out of bed. She thinks about her ex-boyfriend all the time. She says that she experienced similar symptoms for about 2 months after previous relationships ended. The patient is 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 45 kg (100 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.1\u00b0C (97\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination she appears sad and cries easily. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Major depressive disorder\nB) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\nC) Dysthymia\nD)  Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood\nE)  Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood\nAnswer: B) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\nThe correct answer is B) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood. The patient's symptoms began after a significant life change (her boyfriend left her), and she has a history of similar symptoms after previous relationships ended. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is characterized by the development of depressive symptoms in response to a significant life change or stressor. The symptoms must be less severe than those required for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The patient's symptoms are not severe enough to meet the criteria for major depressive disorder, and she does not have a history of dysthymia. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms are primarily depressive, not anxious. \nThe following text has been rewritten with all gender-specific references (male \u2194 female):\nA 20-year-old college student comes to the physician because he has been extremely sad for the past 3 weeks and has to cry constantly.
