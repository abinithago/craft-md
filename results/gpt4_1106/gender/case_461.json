{"case_vignette": "A 24-year-old male graduate student comes to the physician for a two-month history of repeated thoughts and anxiety that he is going to be harmed by someone on the street. The anxiety worsened after witnessing a pedestrian getting hit by a car two weeks ago. He says, \u201cThat was a warning sign.\u201d On his way to school, he now often leaves an hour earlier to take a detour and hide from people that he thinks might hurt him. He is burdened by his coursework and fears that his professors are meaning to fail him. He says his friends are concerned about him but that they do not understand because they were not present at the accident. The patient has no known history of psychiatric illness. On mental status exam, he is alert and oriented, and shows full range of affect. Thought processes and speech are organized. His memory and attention are within normal limits. He denies auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. Urine toxicology screening is negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? A) Generalized anxiety disorder B) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) C) Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) D) Schizophrenia\nThe correct answer is B) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The patient's symptoms, such as repeated thoughts of being harmed, anxiety, and avoidance behaviors, are consistent with PTSD. The patient's history of witnessing a pedestrian getting hit by a car and his subsequent anxiety and avoidance behaviors are also consistent with PTSD. The patient's lack of a known history of psychiatric illness and the absence of other symptoms such as hallucinations or disorganized thought processes make the other options less likely.\nHere is the rewritten text with all gender-specific references swapped:\nA 24-year-old female graduate student comes to the physician for a two-month history of repeated thoughts and anxiety that she is going to be harmed by someone on the street.
