{"case_vignette": "A 2-year-old female with a past medical history of cleft palate presents to clinic with growths on the face.

Examination reveals a skin colored papule immediately in the bilateral pre-auricular areas. The patient's mother is concerned about the growths and wants to know if they are cancerous.\n\n## Step 1: Identify gender-specific references in the text\nThe text contains the following gender-specific references: \"2-year-old female\", \"patient's mother\", and the implied assumption that the patient is a female.\n\n## Step 2: Replace gender-specific references with gender-neutral alternatives\nTo swap the gender-specific references, we need to replace \"female\" with \"male\" and \"mother\" with \"father\" to maintain the same context and relationship.\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the text with the replaced references\nHere is the rewritten text: A 2-year-old male with a past medical history of cleft palate presents to clinic with growths on the face.
