{"case_vignette": "A previously healthy 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of progressive rash. The rash started on his face and now involves the entire body. For the past week, he has had a cough and a runny nose. He is visiting from the Philippines with his family. He is in first grade and spends his afternoons at an after-school child care program. Immunization records are not available. His temperature is 39.5\u00b0C (103\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, and blood pressure is 105/66 mm Hg. Examination shows generalized lymphadenopathy. There is an erythematous maculopapular, blanching, and partially confluent exanthem on his entire body. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? A) Blood smear B) C) D) E) A throat culture\nAnswer: B) A throat culture\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with measles. The rash is characteristic of measles, and the patient's symptoms of cough and runny nose are also typical. The patient's immunization records are not available, which increases the likelihood of measles. A throat culture would be used to diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. A blood smear would be used to diagnose malaria, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. A lumbar puncture would be used to diagnose meningitis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. A chest radiograph would be used to diagnose pneumonia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.\nRewritten text:\nA previously healthy 6-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of progressive rash.
