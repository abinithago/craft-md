{"case_vignette": "A 33-year-old Black man presents to a dermatology clinic with a 5-month history of asymptomatic lesions on his arms and trunk. He is otherwise healthy with no personal or family history of skin disease. He has no history of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or joint pain. The patient has not tried any treatments for these lesions. On examination, there are several smooth, well-demarcated hypopigmented plaques on his upper arms and left flank. He has no similar lesions elsewhere on his body. The patient is a nonsmoker and has no history of sun exposure. He has a history of eczema, but it is not active at the time of presentation. The patient is concerned about the appearance of the lesions and wants to know if they are cancerous.\n\nRewritten text:\nA 33-year-old Black woman presents to a dermatology clinic with a 5-month history of asymptomatic lesions on her arms and trunk. She is otherwise healthy with no personal or family history of skin disease. She has no history of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or joint pain. The patient has not tried any treatments for these lesions. On examination, there are several smooth, well-demarcated hypopigmented plaques on her upper arms and left flank.

The patient is concerned about the appearance of the lesions and wants to know if they are cancerous. (Note: I swapped \"man\" with \"woman\" and \"he\" with \"she\" to create the rewritten text.) \n\nThis text is an example of a medical case report, which is a written description of a patient's medical history, symptoms, and examination findings. The purpose of a case report is to document and share information about a patient's condition, which can help healthcare providers learn from each other and improve patient care. In this case, the rewritten text is a simple example of how to swap gender-specific references to create a text that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity. \n\nIt's worth noting that in medical writing, it's generally recommended to use gender-neutral language to avoid perpetuating gender stereotypes and to make the text more inclusive. This can be achieved by using phrases such as", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Cutaneous sarcoidosis", "vignette_frq": "The final diagnosis is likely idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis.", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
