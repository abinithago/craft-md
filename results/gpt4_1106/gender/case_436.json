{"case_vignette": "A 24-year-old man comes to the physician with a wound on his forearm. He says that he injured himself by absentmindedly walking into a glass door. He does not have health insurance. He has had 5 jobs in the past 8 months. He quit each job after 3\u20134 weeks because he found the work beneath him. He was imprisoned 6 years ago for credit card fraud. He was released from prison on parole a year ago. He was expelled from school at the age of 13 years for stealing school property and threatening to assault a teacher. He has fathered 6 children with 4 women. He says that he does not provide child support because he needs the money for his own personal expenses. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the forearm shows a 6 cm long, 0.5 cm deep wound with neat edges on the dorsal surface of the left forearm. There are bruises on the left shoulder, back, and the proximal phalanges of the right hand. On mental status examination, the patient is alert and calm. His mood is described as cheerful. His thought process, thought content, and speech are normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Antisocial Personality Disorder\nB)  Antisocial Personality Disorder\nC)  Antisocial Personality Disorder\nD)  Antisocial Personality Disorder\n\nAnswer: A) Antisocial Personality Disorder\nExplanation: The patient's history of multiple jobs, imprisonment, expulsion from school, and fathering multiple children without providing child support are all indicative of antisocial personality disorder.
