{"case_vignette": "A 24-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with her boyfriend 2 hours after an episode of loss of consciousness. She was seated and was being tattooed on her right upper flank when she became diaphoretic, pale, and passed out. According to her boyfriend, the patient slipped to the floor and her arms and legs moved in a jerky fashion for a few seconds. She regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately. She has no history of serious illness. She works as an event manager and has had more stress than usual due to a recent concert tour. She appears well. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 120/72 mm Hg. Her cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Vasovagal syncope\nB) C) Torsades de Pointes\nC) D) Tachyarrhythmia\nD) E) Torsades de Pointes\nE) F) Tachyarrhythmia\nAnswer: A) Vasovagal syncope\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of loss of consciousness, diaphoresis, pallor, and a jerky, brief movement of her arms and legs are classic for vasovagal syncope. The fact that she was being tattooed, a painful procedure, and had been experiencing stress due to a recent concert tour, are also risk factors for vasovagal syncope. The ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block, which is a benign finding. Torsades de pointes and tachyarrhythmia are not supported by the patient's symptoms or ECG findings. (Note: The patient's boyfriend is now a girlfriend.) \nThe best answer is A.  (Note: The patient's boyfriend is now a girlfriend.)  (Skill 1a)  The patient's symptoms of loss of consciousness, diaphoresis, pallor, and a jerky, brief movement of her arms and legs are classic for vasovagal syncope.
