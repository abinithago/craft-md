{"case_vignette": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of right-sided blurry vision and eye pain for 4 days. She has a 6-day history of low-grade fever, headache, and malaise. One year ago, she was diagnosed with Crohn disease. Her only medication is prednisone. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 84/min, and blood pressure is 112/75 mm Hg. The right eyelid is erythematous and tender; there are multiple vesicles over the right forehead and the tip of the nose. Visual acuity is 20/20 in the left eye and 20/80 in the right eye. Extraocular movements are normal. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and reduced corneal sensitivity. Fluorescein staining shows a corneal lesion with a tree-like pattern. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Herpes simplex keratitis\nB)  Herpes zoster ophthalmicus\nC)  Herpes zoster keratitis\nD)  Herpes simplex encephalitis\nE)  Herpes zoster encephalitis\n\nAnswer: B) Herpes zoster ophthalmicus\n\nThe text describes a 23-year-old woman with symptoms of right-sided blurry vision and eye pain, along with a history of low-grade fever, headache, and malaise. She has a history of Crohn disease and is taking prednisone. The physical examination reveals erythema and tenderness of the right eyelid, multiple vesicles on the right forehead and nose, conjunctival injection, and reduced corneal sensitivity. Fluorescein staining shows a corneal lesion with a tree-like pattern. The most likely diagnosis is Herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which is a viral infection caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. It typically presents with a painful rash and vesicles on one side of the face, often accompanied by eye symptoms such as conjunctivitis and reduced corneal sensitivity. The tree-like pattern on fluorescein staining is characteristic of this condition. The other options are less likely, as Herpes simplex keratitis typically presents with a dendritic pattern on fluorescein staining, and Herpes zoster keratitis and Herpes simplex encephalitis are less common and would not typically present with the same symptoms", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "trial_0": {"vignette_mcq": "Herpes zoster keratitis", "vignette_frq": "B) Herpes zoster ophthalmicus", "multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Infectious Diseases.
