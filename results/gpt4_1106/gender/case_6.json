The patient is a college student and is otherwise healthy. She denies any recent travel or exposure to animals.

The patient is concerned about the possibility of a viral infection, but the lack of systemic symptoms makes this less likely. The patient is concerned about the possibility of a skin cancer, but the lack of a history of sun exposure or a family history of skin cancer makes this less likely.
