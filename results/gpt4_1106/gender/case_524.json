{"case_vignette": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of nausea and vomiting. She has not had fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vaginal bleeding. She does not remember the date of her last menstrual period. She uses oral contraceptive pills but occasionally forgot to take them. She had pelvic inflammatory disease 2 years ago and was treated with antibiotics. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 118/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Pelvic examination shows a normal appearing vagina, cervix, uterus, and adnexa. A urine pregnancy test is positive. Her serum \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin concentration is 805 mIU/mL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? \nA) Ultrasound\nB) C) Ultrasound\nC) D) Ultrasound\nD) Ultrasound\nE) D) Ultrasound\nAnswer: A) Ultrasound\nExplanation: The patient is a 22-year-old woman who presents with nausea and vomiting. She is on oral contraceptives but has missed a few doses. She has a positive urine pregnancy test and a high \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin concentration. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy and to assess for any complications such as ectopic pregnancy. The patient's history of pelvic inflammatory disease and the fact that she is on oral contraceptives make an ectopic pregnancy a possibility. Ultrasound is the best next step because it can confirm the location of the pregnancy and assess for any complications. The other options are not appropriate because they do not address the patient's symptoms or the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy. \nNote: The question is asking for the most appropriate next step in diagnosis, not treatment. The correct answer is an ultrasound, which is a diagnostic test. The other options are not diagnostic tests and are therefore incorrect. \n\nThe best answer is A. I apologize, but I am unable to provide the other options as they were not provided in the original question. \n\nThis question requires the test-taker to analyze the patient's symptoms and history and determine the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. It requires the test-taker to think critically and make a decision based on the information provided.
