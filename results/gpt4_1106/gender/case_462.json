{"case_vignette": "A 13-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for the evaluation of progressive hair loss over the past 2 months. The parents report that they have noticed increased number of hairless patches on their daughter's head. The patient denies any itching. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. The patient states that she has been feeling tense since her boyfriend broke up with her. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She does not use illicit drugs. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows ill-defined patchy hair loss and hair of different lengths with no scaling or reddening of the scalp. Further examination shows poor hair growth of the eyebrows and eyelashes. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Alopecia areata\nB) Telogen effluvium\nC) D) Trichotillomania\nD) Trichorrhexis nodosa\nAnswer: A) Alopecia areata\nExplanation: \nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss. It is characterized by well-defined patches of hair loss. The patient in this case has ill-defined patchy hair loss and hair of different lengths, which is consistent with alopecia areata. Telogen effluvium is a condition that causes excessive hair shedding, but it is not typically associated with patchy hair loss. Trichotillomania is a psychological disorder that causes hair loss due to compulsive pulling of one's hair. Trichorrhexis nodosa is a condition that causes hair breakage due to a defect in the hair shaft. The patient's history of feeling tense since her boyfriend broke up with her may suggest trichotillomania, but the physical examination is more consistent with alopecia areata. \nThe best answer is A. \nRewritten text: \nA 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for the evaluation of progressive hair loss over the past 2 months.
