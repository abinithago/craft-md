{"case_vignette": "A 43-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of chest pain. She describes the pain as intermittent and burning-like. She states that she has tried using proton pump inhibitors but has had no relief of her symptoms. She has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss over the past 2 months. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. Examination shows tightness of the skin of the fingers; there are small nonhealing, nonpurulent ulcers over thickened skin on the fingertips. Fine inspiratory crackles are heard at both lung bases. There is mild tenderness to palpation of the epigastrium. Which of the following is most likely associated with her diagnosis? A) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) B) Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) C) Dyspepsia D) Eosinophilic esophagitis E) Celiac disease\nAnswer: A) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\nThe patient's symptoms of intermittent, burning-like chest pain and weight loss are suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The presence of fine inspiratory crackles at both lung bases may indicate aspiration pneumonia, which is a complication of GERD. The patient's skin tightness and nonhealing ulcers on the fingertips are suggestive of scleroderma, which is associated with GERD. The patient's epigastric tenderness may be related to the GERD as well. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may be related to the scleroderma. The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and regurgitation are not present, making dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and celiac disease less likely.\nThe correct answer is A) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient's symptoms of intermittent, burning-like chest pain and weight loss are suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
