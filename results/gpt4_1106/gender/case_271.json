{"case_vignette": "A 42-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her husband because of a 1-year history of abnormal behavior. During this time she has been irritable, restless, and has had multiple episodes of hearing voices. Over the past month, she has also had difficulty swallowing. She has a 2-year history of depression. She was let go by her employer 6 months ago because she could no longer handle all her tasks and often forgot about assignments. Her father committed suicide at the age of 50. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily over the past 20 years. She has a history of smoking cocaine for 8 years but stopped 1 year ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is confused and oriented to person and place only. Neurologic examination shows a delayed return to neutral ankle position after triggering the plantar reflex. Physical examination shows irregular, nonrepetitive, and arrhythmic movements of the neck and head. The patient has poor articulation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Schizophrenia\nB) Huntington's disease\nC) Dementia\nD) E) Other\nAnswer: B) Huntington's disease\nThe correct answer is B) Huntington's disease. The patient's symptoms, including the delayed return to neutral ankle position after triggering the plantar reflex and the irregular, nonrepetitive, and arrhythmic movements of the neck and head, are characteristic of Huntington's disease. The patient's history of depression and smoking cocaine are not relevant to the diagnosis. The patient's history of smoking cigarettes is also not relevant to the diagnosis. The patient's father committed suicide at the age of 50, which is a risk factor for Huntington's disease. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with schizophrenia, which is characterized by hallucinations and delusions. The patient's symptoms are also not consistent with dementia, which is characterized by a decline in cognitive function. \nThe best answer is B.  (Skill 1a)\nHuntington's disease is a progressive brain disorder caused by a genetic mutation. It is characterized by the degeneration of nerve cells in the brain, leading to a loss of motor control, cognitive decline, and psychiatric problems. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disease.
