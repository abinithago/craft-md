{"case_vignette": "A 45-year-old woman presents with oval-shaped lesions on her arms that she first noted a few months ago. The lesions began as an area of discrete erythema, progressed to induration, and then became dark, smooth, and shiny. She has a family history of rheumatoid arthritis. On examination, the patient has multiple hyperpigmented and hypopigmented indurated plaques with a shiny surface; her nails and fingertips are normal, and autoantibody tests were negative. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of dermatomyositis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the skin and muscles. The patient's symptoms are likely due to an autoimmune response, and the patient's family history of rheumatoid arthritis may be relevant to her condition.\n\nOriginal text:\nA 45-year-old man presents with oval-shaped lesions on his arms that he first noted a few months ago.
