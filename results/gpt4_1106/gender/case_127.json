I also swapped the word \"bilateral axilla\" to \"bilateral axilla\" since it is a medical term that refers to the armpits, which is a location that is not specific to one gender. I did not change the word \"inframmary folds\" since it is a medical term that refers to the skin folds under the breasts, which is a location that is not specific to one gender.
