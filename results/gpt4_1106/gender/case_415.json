{"case_vignette": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has not had her menstrual period yet. At birth, she was found to have partial labial fusion and clitoromegaly. The mother reports that during the pregnancy she had noticed abnormal hair growth on her chin. The girl has severe acne. Three years ago, she broke her wrist after a minor trauma. Last year, she sustained a spinal compression fracture after lifting a box during a move. She currently takes oral isotretinoin and an oral contraceptive. The patient is at the 97th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows numerous inflamed pustules on her face and upper back. Breast development is at Tanner stage I. The patient refuses to have a pelvic examination. A pelvic ultrasound shows ovaries with multiple cysts and a normal uterus. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? \nA) Turner syndrome\nB) Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome\nC) D) Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia\nD) Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia\nE) Other\nAnswer: C) D) Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia\nThe correct answer is C) D) Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia. The patient's symptoms, including clitoromegaly, abnormal hair growth, severe acne, and multiple fractures, are consistent with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is a group of inherited disorders that affect the adrenal glands, leading to an overproduction of androgens. This can cause virilization in females, including clitoromegaly and abnormal hair growth. The patient's multiple fractures are also consistent with CAH, as individuals with this condition often have osteoporosis due to the effects of androgens on bone metabolism. The pelvic ultrasound showing ovaries with multiple cysts and a normal uterus also supports this diagnosis, as CAH typically does not affect the development of the uterus. \n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA) Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females, characterized by short stature, ovarian dysgenesis, and other physical abnormalities. The patient's height and weight percentiles do not support this diagnosis.\n\nB) Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) is a condition where individuals are genetically male but have a female phenotype due to resistance to androgens.
