{"case_vignette": "A 55-year-old male with past medical history of Jewish ancestry presents with painful oral lesions and few \"waterboils\" on the arms for the past three months. His only medications include multivitamin and atorvastatin which he has been on for the past 15 years without any dosage changes. He denies any recent travel or genital uclers. A full skin examination is remarkable for irregularly shaped erosions of the buccal and palatine mucosa and scattered flaccid bullae on the arms with few scattered crusted erosions.
