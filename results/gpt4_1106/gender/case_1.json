He initially noticed redness, irritation, and pustules around his nails that he thought were caused by an infection. However, the rash progressed to affect the nail bed, eventually destroying his nails. On examination, well-demarcated, scaly plaques with associated pustules and nail atrophy are present on the right second and third distal digits. He is otherwise healthy. The patient has a history of eczema and asthma, but these conditions have been well-controlled with medication. The patient is a nonsmoker and does not drink alcohol. He has a family history of psoriasis, but his mother has a history of psoriasis, not his father. The patient is concerned about the appearance of his nails and the potential impact on his work as a software engineer.\n\nRewritten text:\nA 51-year-old white woman presents to the clinic with a 2-year history of a painful, recurrent rash on her fingers.
