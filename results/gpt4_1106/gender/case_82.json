{"case_vignette": "A 65-year-old man of Middle Eastern descent presents with a tender, weeping mass on his right palm.

His medical history is significant for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and lung cancer, which was treated with right lobectomy.

The patient's family history is significant for lung cancer in his mother and father. The patient's social history is significant for a 30-year history of working in construction, with exposure to asbestos, silica, and other chemicals. The patient's physical examination is notable for a 0.9-cm, pink, pedunculated nodule on the right palm, with a serous crust. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results are significant for a slightly elevated white blood cell count. The patient's chest X-ray shows a right upper lobe mass, which is consistent with his history of lung cancer. The patient's skin biopsy results are pending.\n\nRewritten text:\nA 65-year-old woman of Middle Eastern descent presents with a tender, weeping mass on her right palm.
