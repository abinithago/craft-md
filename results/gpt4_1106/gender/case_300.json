She is originally from Nigeria and visits her family there twice a year; her last trip was 3 months ago. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Her left eye is notable for ciliary injection and photophobia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. An x-ray of the chest is shown.
