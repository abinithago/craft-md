The patient was the front seat passenger in a head on collision. The patient is responsive only to painful stimuli.

The patient is started on IV fluids and is given blood products. A FAST exam reveals no signs of intra-abdominal bleeding. A chest radiograph is ordered as seen in Figure A. A pelvic binder is placed and fluid and blood resuscitation is continued. Fifteen minutes later his temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.
