His temperature is 97.7\u00b0F (36.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 134/85 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a healthy man with a normal gait. The patient has a physiologic nystagmus and his cranial nerve exam is unremarkable. The patient\u2019s head is turned to the left and he is laid back on the stretcher, which exacerbates severe symptoms with a nystagmus notable.
