At first, the area seemed numb and she recalls touching a hot stove and accidentally burning herself but not feeling the heat. Now she is suffering from a constant, uncomfortable burning pain on her left side for the past week. The pain gets worse when someone even lightly touches that side. She has recently immigrated and her past medical records are unavailable. Last month she had a stroke but she cannot recall any details from the event. She confirms a history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and bilateral knee pain. She also had cardiac surgery 20 years ago. She denies fever, mood changes, weight changes, and trauma to the head, neck, or limbs. Her blood pressure is 162/90 mm Hg, the heart rate is 82/min, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. Multiple old burn marks are visible on the left hand and forearm. Muscle strength is mildly reduced in the left upper and lower limbs. Hyperesthesia is noted in the left upper and lower limbs.
