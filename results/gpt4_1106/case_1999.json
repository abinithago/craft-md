{"case_id": "case_1999", "case_vignette": "A 12-month-old boy is brought in by his mother who is worried about pallor. She says that the patient has always been fair-skinned, but over the past month relatives have commented that he appears more pale. The mother says that the patient seems to tire easy, but plays well with his older brother and has even started to walk. She denies bloody or black stools, easy bruising, or excess bleeding. She states that he is a picky eater, but he loves crackers and whole milk. On physical examination, pallor of the conjunctiva is noted. There is a grade II systolic ejection murmur best heard over the lower left sternal border that increases when the patient is supine.
