{"case_id": "case_521", "case_vignette": "Five days after undergoing an open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, a 68-year-old woman has crampy abdominal pain. During this period, she has also had two episodes of loose, bloody stools. Her surgery was complicated by severe blood loss requiring the administration of vasopressors and multiple transfusions. Cefazolin was administered as a perioperative antibiotic. The patient has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years and drinks 3\u20134 glasses of wine every week. Her current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin, amlodipine, aspirin, and metoprolol. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 96/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a distended abdomen with absent bowel sounds. The abdomen is exquisitely tender to palpation in all quadrants. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows an S4 gallop. An x-ray of the abdomen shows air-filled distended bowel.
