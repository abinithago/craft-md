In addition, the daughter also complains of constipation for which she increased her fiber intake, but the dietary changes are not helping her. She began menstruating at the age of 13, and her menstrual cycles are regular (about 28 days). On physical examination, the patient has a large, non-tender, mobile adnexal mass in the left lower quadrant. The pelvic examination is normal except for the presence of the adnexal mass. The patient is advised to have an outpatient ultrasound, and then return to the clinic next week. After 2 weeks, you learned that the patient visited the emergency department for a sudden onset of abdominal pain that required observation after an abdominal ultrasound was performed. The ultrasound showed a large simple cystic mass with increased internal echoes, having a diameter of 10 cm and hyperechogenic vascular walls on the left ovary with a small intraperitoneal collection in the pouch of Douglas.
