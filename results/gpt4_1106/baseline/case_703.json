He attributes his weight loss to recently eating very small portions and avoiding fatty foods. He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft operation for coronary artery disease 8 years ago. Current medications include lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and aspirin. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks 1\u20132 beers daily. His pulse is 79/min and blood pressure is 138/89 mm Hg.
