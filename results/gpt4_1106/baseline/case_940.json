The symptoms can be relieved by shaking his hands but soon recur. He reports weakness of his right hand, especially when grasping objects. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications are metformin and sitagliptin. Four months ago he went on a camping trip. He has been working as a hardscaper for 8 years. His temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse is 86/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows reproduction of his symptoms when his right hand is held above his head for 2 minutes.
