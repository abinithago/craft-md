When she closes her left eye, she has blurry double vision. She does not recall trauma to her eye but has been working long nights on her honors thesis. She has a history of occasional shoulder luxation. She is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall, and weighs 62 kg (136 lbs); her BMI is 19.1 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, slender and long fingers are noted. She has several flat, demarcated brownish nevi on her left cheek. Ocular examination shows upward temporal subluxation of her right lens.
