She has multiple non-bloody, watery bowel movements daily and experiences abdominal cramping. Sometimes, she feels sudden palpitations, is short of breath, and her face becomes red. She has lost 7 kg over the past 3 months. She went on a 3-week hiking trip to Cambodia 6 months ago. She has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. Her temperature is 37\u02daC (98.6\u00b0F), her pulse is 72/min and her blood pressure is 125/70 mm Hg. On physical examination, tiny blood vessels are noted on her face and arms. Lung auscultation shows bilateral wheezing. The abdomen is soft and nondistended. There is localized tenderness to the right lower quadrant, but no rebound tenderness or guarding. Laboratory studies show:\nLeukocyte count 4,600 /mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 61 %\nEosinophils 2 %\nPlatelet count 254,000 /mm3\nHemoglobin 13.1 g/dL\nSerum\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) 110 IU/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) 128 IU/L\nC-reactive protein 8 mg/dL (N = 0\u201310)\n",
