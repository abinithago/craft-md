He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0 F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. ",

Ask different questions to cover more information. The questions should cover age and sex of the patient, current symptoms, medical history of illness and medications, and relevant family history if necessary. Keep your questions short and brief to not confuse the patient.  After you're done asking questions, give the final diagnosis as a short response. Do not explain, only give the diagnosis name. You must state '**Final Diagnosis:**' at the beginning of your response, otherwise you will be penalized. You must give only 1 diagnosis otherwise you will be penalized."
