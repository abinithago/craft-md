He has hypercholesterolemia and hypertension treated with atorvastatin and labetalol. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 35 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a 4-cm (1.6-in), nontender, pulsatile mass with a palpable thrill at the right midinguinal point. On auscultation, a harsh continuous murmur is heard over the mass.
