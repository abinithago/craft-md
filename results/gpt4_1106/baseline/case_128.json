Physical examination reveals diffuse pink erythematous patches of the chest, back with few scattered dusky central patches and multiple bullae. Applying pressure with a finger and moving laterally results in separation of the skin on many areas of the back. Oral erosions on the lips and on the glans penis are appreciated.
