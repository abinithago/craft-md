She and her parents, who are refugees from Sudan, arrived in Texas a month ago. Her immunization status is not known. She is at the 25th percentile for weight and the 50th percentile for height. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. Examination of the right eye shows matting of the eyelashes. Everting the right eyelid shows hyperemia, follicles, and papillae on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Slit-lamp examination of the right eye shows follicles in the limbic region and the bulbar conjunctiva. There is corneal haziness with neovascularization at the 12 o'clock position. Examination of the left eye is unremarkable. Direct opthalmoscopy of both eyes shows no abnormalities. Right pre-auricular lymphadenopathy is present. ",
