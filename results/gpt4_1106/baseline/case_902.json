His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 102/62 mm Hg. Examination shows vesicles and flaccid bullae with thin brown crusts on the chest. Lateral traction of the surrounding skin leads to sloughing. Examination of the oral mucosa shows no abnormalities.
