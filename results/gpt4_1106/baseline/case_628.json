{"case_vignette": "A 50-year-old woman comes to the physician because of blisters on her forearm that appeared 3 days ago. She also reports pain in her left cheek when eating and pain during sexual intercourse for the past week. She has not been sick for the past 6 months. She has started hiking in the woods on the weekends with her son a couple months ago but has been careful to avoid poison ivy. She has a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. She recently started taking captopril and stopped taking meloxicam 2 weeks ago. She has a family history of pernicious anemia and Graves' disease. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits. Examination reveals multiple, flaccid blisters on the volar surface of the forearm and ulcers on the buccal, gingival, and vulvar mucosa. The epidermis on the forearm separates when the skin is lightly stroked. The total body surface area involvement of the blisters is estimated to be 10%.
