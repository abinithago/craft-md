Physical examination shows cutaneous flushing of the face. Auscultation of the chest shows bilateral wheezing. A 24-hour urine collection shows increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen shows an intestinal tumor with extensive metastasis to the liver. A diagnosis of an inoperable disease is made and the patient is started on treatment with octreotide. Six weeks later, the patient's symptoms have improved except for his abdominal pain and frequent loose stools. The physician suggests enrolling the patient in a trial to test additional treatment with a new drug that has been shown to improve symptoms in other patients with the same condition. ",

Ask different questions to cover more information. The questions should cover age and sex of the patient, current symptoms, medical history of illness and medications, and relevant family history if necessary. Keep your questions short and brief to not confuse the patient.  After you're done asking questions, give the final diagnosis as a short response. Do not explain, only give the diagnosis name. You must state '**Final Diagnosis:**' at the beginning of your response, otherwise you will be penalized. You must give only 1 diagnosis otherwise you will be penalized."
