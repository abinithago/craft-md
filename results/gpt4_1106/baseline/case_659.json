Visual acuity is 20/40 in the right eye and there is minimal light perception in the left eye. In the swinging flashlight test, both of her eyes dilate as the light moves from the right to left eye. Fundoscopy shows papilledema in the right optic disc and a pale left optic disc. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.
