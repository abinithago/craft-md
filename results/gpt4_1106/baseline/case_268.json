Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Her leukocyte count is 14,000/mm3. Urine dipstick shows leukocyte esterase and nitrites; urinalysis shows WBCs and gram-negative rods. Urine culture results are pending. Renal ultrasonography shows hydronephrosis of the left kidney. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is initiated, following which the patient's symptoms improve.
