He is at the 95 percentile for height, 20 percentile for weight, and 95 percentile for head circumference. He appears shy. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 100/55 mm Hg. Examination shows elongated facial features and large ears. The patient does not speak.
