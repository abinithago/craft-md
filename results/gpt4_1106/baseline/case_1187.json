He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 10 years. BMI is 18 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination is unremarkable. Serum studies show an osmolality of 305 mOsm/L and bicarbonate of 17 mEq/L. Urinalysis shows clear-colored urine with no organisms. ",
