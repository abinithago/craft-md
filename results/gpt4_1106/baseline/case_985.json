She has been coming to the physician multiple times over the past year for minor problems. She is dressed very extravagantly and flirts with the receptionist. When she is asked to sit down in the waiting room, she begins to cry and says that no one listens to her. When she is called to the examination room, she moves close to the physician, repeatedly intends to touch his cheek, and makes inappropriate comments.
