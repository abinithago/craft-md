After birth, the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated for 3 weeks because of hypoxia. He required a 60% fraction of inspired oxygen to achieve adequate oxygen saturation. His temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 144/min, respirations are 59/min, and blood pressure is 65/35 mm Hg. Physical examination shows labored breathing, intercostal retractions, and crackles at both lung bases. There is bluish discoloration around the lips. An x-ray of the chest shows interspersed areas of atelectasis, granular densities, and hyperinflation. ",
