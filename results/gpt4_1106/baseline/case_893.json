    "case_vignette": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of pain in her right thumb and wrist that radiates to her elbow. It is worse when she holds her infant son and improves with the use of an ice pack. Six months ago, she slipped on a wet floor and fell on her right outstretched hand. Her mother takes methotrexate for chronic joint pain. The patient takes ibuprofen as needed for her current symptoms. Examination of the right hand shows tenderness over the radial styloid with swelling but no redness. There is no crepitus. Grasping her right thumb and exerting longitudinal traction toward the ulnar side elicits pain. Range of motion of the finger joints is normal. There is no swelling, redness, or tenderness of any other joints. ",
