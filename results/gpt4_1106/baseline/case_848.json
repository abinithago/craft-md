    "case_vignette": "A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician because of vision impairment in her right eye for the past 2 weeks. During this period, she was unable to distinguish colors with her right eye. She also reports pain with eye movement. She has no double vision. She occasionally has headaches that are relieved by ibuprofen. One year ago, she had a similar episode that affected her left eye and resolved spontaneously. She has no history of serious illness. She works at a library and enjoys reading, even in poor lighting conditions. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Without correction, visual acuity is 20/50 in the left eye, and 20/100 in the right eye. With spectacles, the visual acuity is 20/20 in the left eye and 20/100 in the right eye. Slit lamp examination shows no abnormalities. A CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. ",
