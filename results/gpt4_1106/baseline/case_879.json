He has been making inappropriate comments and jokes while talking to friends and family members. He was arrested 3 weeks ago while trying to kiss strangers on the street. He has no interest in talking to his daughter or playing with his grandchildren. During this period, he has developed a strong desire for chocolate pudding and potato chips and has gained 10 kg (22 lb). He appears unkempt. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. Mental status examination shows apathy and a blunt affect. He avoids answering questions and instead comments on the individuals he saw in the waiting room. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 28/30. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of glucose, creatine, and electrolytes are within the reference range. ",
