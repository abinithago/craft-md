{"case_vignette": "A 29-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of a swollen right knee. Over the past several weeks, he has had similar episodes affecting the right knee and sometimes also the left elbow, in which the swelling lasted an average of 5 days. He has a history of a rash that subsided 2 months ago. He lives in Connecticut with his wife and works as a landscaper. His temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and warm right knee; range of motion is limited by pain. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. His hematocrit is 44%, leukocyte count is 10,300/mm3, and platelet count is 145,000/mm3. Serum electrolyte concentrations are within normal limits. Arthrocentesis is performed and the synovial fluid is cloudy. Gram stain is negative. Analysis of the synovial fluid shows a leukocyte count of 70,000/mm3 and 80% neutrophils. Serologic testing confirms the diagnosis.
