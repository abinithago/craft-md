The girlfriend reports that, over the past 3 months, the patient has become withdrawn and stopped pursuing hobbies that he used to enjoy. One month ago, he lost his job because he stopped going to work. During this time, he has barely left his apartment because he believes that the FBI is spying on him and controlling his mind. He used to smoke marijuana occasionally in high school but quit 5 years ago. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he is confused and suspicious with marked psychomotor agitation. His speech is disorganized and his affect is labile.
