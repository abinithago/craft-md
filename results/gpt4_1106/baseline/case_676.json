{"case_vignette": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of back pain for the past six months. The pain is worse with exercise and when reclining. He attends high school and is on the swim team. He also states that he lifts weights on a regular basis. He has not had any trauma to the back or any previous problems with his joints. He has no history of serious illness. His father has a disc herniation. Palpation of the spinous processes at the lumbosacral area shows that two adjacent vertebrae are displaced and are at different levels. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is intact throughout. When the patient is asked to walk, a waddling gait is noted. Passive raising of either the right or left leg causes pain radiating down the ipsilateral leg.
