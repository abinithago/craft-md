He lost control at high speed and was thrown forward onto the handlebars. On arrival, he is alert and responsive. He has abdominal pain and superficial lacerations on his left arm. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a tender, erythematous area over his epigastrium. The abdomen is soft and non-distended. A CT scan of the abdomen shows no abnormalities. Treatment with analgesics is begun, the lacerations are cleaned and dressed, and the patient is discharged home after 2 hours of observation. Four days later, the patient returns to the emergency department with gradually worsening upper abdominal pain, fever, poor appetite, and vomiting. His pulse is 91/min and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. ",
