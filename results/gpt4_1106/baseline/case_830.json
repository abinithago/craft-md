They have been sexually active at least twice a week. The husband sometimes has difficulties maintaining erection during sexual activity. During attempted vaginal penetration, the patient has discomfort and her pelvic floor muscles tighten up. Three years ago, the patient was diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder. There is no family history of serious illness. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows normal appearing vulva without redness; there is no vaginal discharge. An initial attempt at speculum examination is aborted after the patient's pelvic floor muscles tense up and she experiences discomfort. ",
