    "case_vignette": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician because of 1 week of progressive left anterior knee pain. The pain is worse after sitting for a prolonged period of time and while ascending stairs. She first noticed the pain the day after a basketball game. She has often taken painful blows to the side of the knees while playing basketball but does not recall this having happened in the last game. Four weeks ago, she was diagnosed with a chlamydial urinary tract infection and treated with azithromycin. She is sexually active with one male partner; they use condoms inconsistently. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 62 kg (137 lb); BMI is 19.6 kg/m2. Physical examination shows tenderness over the left anterior knee that is exacerbated with anterior pressure to the patella when the knee is fully extended; there is no erythema or swelling. ",
