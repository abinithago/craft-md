{"case_vignette": "A 62-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of sudden loss of vision in her right eye that occurred 50 minutes ago. She does not have eye pain. She had several episodes of loss of vision in the past, but her vision improved following treatment with glucocorticoids. She has coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and multiple sclerosis. She underwent a left carotid endarterectomy 3 years ago. She had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago. Current medications include aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, glipizide, and weekly intramuscular beta-interferon injections. Her temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 155/88 mm Hg. Examination shows 20/50 vision in the left eye and no perception of light in the right eye. The direct pupillary reflex is brisk in the left eye and absent in the right eye. The indirect pupillary reflex is brisk in the right eye but absent in the left eye. Intraocular pressure is 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. A white, 1-mm ring is seen around the circumference of the cornea in both eyes. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye shows a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula. The optic disc appears normal. Fundoscopic examination of the left eye shows a few soft and hard exudates in the superior and nasal retinal quadrants. The optic disc and macula appear normal.
