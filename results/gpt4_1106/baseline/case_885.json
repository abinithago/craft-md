The pain is dull and pressure-like and occurs intermittently; the patient is asymptomatic between episodes. Menses occur at regular 30-day intervals and last 8 days with heavy flow. Her last menstrual period ended 5 days ago. She is sexually active and does not use contraception. Her temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 106/68 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows white cervical mucus and a firm, irregularly-shaped uterus consistent in size with a 5-week gestation. A spot urine pregnancy test is negative. ",

Ask only one question at a time, and it should not be more than 1 line. Continue asking questions until you're 100% confident of the diagnosis. Do not ask the same question multiple times. Ask different questions to cover more information. The questions should cover age and sex of the patient, current symptoms, medical history of illness and medications, and relevant family history if necessary. Keep your questions short and brief to not confuse the patient.  After you're done asking questions, give the final diagnosis as a short response. Do not explain, only give the diagnosis name. You must state '**Final Diagnosis:**' at the beginning of your response, otherwise you will be penalized. You must give only 1 diagnosis otherwise you will be penalized."
