On examination of the shoulder joint, severe tenderness was present localized to the greater tuberosity of the left shoulder joint along with biceps tendon tenderness over the bicipital groove. The range of motion was limited to the left side. An X-ray of the joint showed narrowing of the acromiohumeral space with sclerosis and spurring of the acromion.
