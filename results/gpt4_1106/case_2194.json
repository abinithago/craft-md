She says that she has been experiencing palpitations and lightheadedness for the past 6 months, but before this morning the episodes usually resolved on their own. The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for a transient ischemia attack 2 months ago, hypertension, and diabetes. She takes aspirin, metformin, and lisinopril. She states her grandfather died of a stroke, and her mom has a \"blood disorder.\" An electrocardiogram is obtained that shows an irregularly irregular rhythm with rapid ventricular response, consistent with atrial fibrillation. She is given intravenous metoprolol, which resolves her symptoms. In addition to starting a beta-blocker for long-term management, the patient meets criteria for anticoagulation. Both unfractionated heparin and warfarin are started. Five days later, the patient begins complaining of pain and swelling of her left lower extremity. A Doppler ultrasound reveals thrombosis in her right popliteal and tibial veins. A complete blood count is obtained that shows a decrease in platelet count from 245,000/mm^3 to 90,000/mm^3.
