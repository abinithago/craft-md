{"case_id": "case_3296", "case_vignette": "A 14-year-old girl presents to her pediatrician with complaints of repeated jerking of her neck for the past 2 years. Initially, her parents considered it a sign of discomfort in her neck, but later they noticed that the jerking was more frequent when she was under emotional stress or when she was fatigued. The patient says she can voluntarily control the jerking in some social situations, but when she is under stress, she feels the urge to jerk her neck and she feels better after that. The parents also report that during the past year, there have even been a few weeks when the frequency of the neck jerking had decreased drastically, only to increase again afterwards. On physical examination, she is a physically healthy female with normal vital signs. Her neurologic examination is normal. The pediatrician also notes that when he makes certain movements, the patient partially imitates these movements. The parents are very much concerned about her abnormal movements and insist on a complete diagnostic work-up. After a detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations, the pediatrician confirms the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome.
