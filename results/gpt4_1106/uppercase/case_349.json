HER TEMPERATURE IS 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), PULSE IS 150/MIN, RESPIRATIONS ARE 50/MIN, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IS 88/50 MM HG. PULSE OXIMETRY ON ROOM AIR SHOWS AN OXYGEN SATURATION OF 87%. ORAL EXAMINATION SHOWS A WHITE PLAQUE COVERING THE TONGUE THAT BLEEDS WHEN SCRAPED. CHEST EXAMINATION SHOWS SUBCOSTAL AND INTERCOSTAL RETRACTIONS. SCATTERED FINE CRACKLES AND RHONCHI ARE HEARD THROUGHOUT BOTH LUNG FIELDS. LABORATORY STUDIES SHOW A LEUKOCYTE COUNT OF 21,000/MM3 AND AN INCREASED SERUM BETA-D-GLUCAN CONCENTRATION. AN X-RAY OF THE CHEST SHOWS SYMMETRICAL, DIFFUSE INTERSTITIAL INFILTRATES.
