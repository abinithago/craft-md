{"case_vignette": "A 3-week-old newborn is brought to    the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is    greenish    in color and smells strange. His par ents have tried to    feed him every 4 hours, but the patient  often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel m   ovement at 50 hours of life. He has since had  one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th p   erce  ntile for head circumference. He does not appe   ar to be in acute distress. His temperature   is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 140/min, respirations a   re 40/min  , and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination     shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and sec ond toes bilaterally. The abdomen    is distended.   When the finger is removed following a rectal e   xam, there is an explosive release of  stool fro m th   e patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon   followed by a segment of colon without stool or air.
