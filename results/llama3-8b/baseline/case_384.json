Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows jugular venous pulsations 9 cm above the sternal angle. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is a normal S1 and a loud, split S2. An impulse can be felt with the fingers left of the sternum. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The fingertips are enlarged and the nails are curved. There is pitting edema around the ankles bilaterally. An x-ray of the chest shows pronounced central pulmonary arteries and a prominent right heart border.
