{"case_vignette": "A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air.
