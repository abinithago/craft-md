Examination shows multiple abrasions over his abdomen and extremities. There is a 2.5-cm (1-in) laceration on the left side of the chest. There are decreased breath sounds over the left base. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and there is tenderness to palpation over the left upper quadrant. Bowel sounds are normal. His hemoglobin concentration is 13.6 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,110/mm3, and platelet count is 190,000/mm3. A chest x-ray is shown.
