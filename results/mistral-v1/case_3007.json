{"case_id": "case_3007", "case_vignette": "A 51-year-old woman with a history of palpitations is being evaluated by a surgeon for epigastric pain. It is discovered that she has an epigastric hernia that needs repair. During her preoperative evaluation, she is ordered to receive lab testing, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a chest X-ray. These screening studies are unremarkable except for her chest X-ray, which shows a 2 cm isolated pulmonary nodule in the middle lobe of the right lung. The nodule has poorly defined margins, and it shows a dense, irregular pattern of calcification. The patient is immediately referred to a pulmonologist for evaluation of the lesion. The patient denies any recent illnesses and states that she has not traveled outside of the country since she was a child. She has had no sick contacts or respiratory symptoms, and she does not currently take any medications. She does, however, admit to a 20-pack-year history of smoking.
