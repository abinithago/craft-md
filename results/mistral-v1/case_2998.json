{"case_id": "case_2998", "case_vignette": "A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with moderate right wrist pain after falling on her outstretched hand. She has numbness in the 3 medial digits. The patient has no known previous medical conditions. Her family history is not pertinent, and she currently takes no medications. Physical examination shows her blood pressure is 134/82 mm Hg, the respirations are 14/min, the pulse is 87/min, and the temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). When asked to make a fist, the patient is able to flex only the lateral 2 digits. Tapping the anterior portion of her wrist elicits tingling in the medial 3 digits.
