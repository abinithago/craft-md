Both his father who died at the age of 40 years and his uncle (father\u2019s brother), died with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. He has never smoked in his life. His respiratory rate is 19/min and temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient has significantly longer exhalation than inhalation. His expiratory time is longer than 6 seconds. Clubbing is present. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral crackles. Mild hepatomegaly is present.
