When the patient is asked about this, she says that she attended a function at which this actor was the guest of honor six months back, and he waved his hand at her by which she understood that he loves her. However, when she tries to contact him over the phone, he does not respond, which she says is probably because he is too busy with his career at present. When asked why the successful actor would marry her, she says, \u201cCelebrities often prefer to marry ordinary people and that is why he expressed his interest in me that day\u201d. The patient is otherwise healthy with no known medical condition. She denies any mood disturbances, hallucinations, or anxiety.
