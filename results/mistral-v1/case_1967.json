He states that over the past week his right wrist has become increasingly stiff. This morning he noticed pain and stiffness in his left ankle and left knee. The patient has celiac disease and takes a daily multivitamin. He says he is sexually active with multiple male and female partners. He smokes marijuana but denies intravenous drug abuse. He recently traveled to Uganda to volunteer at a clinic that specialized in treating patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He also went on an extended hiking trip last week in New Hampshire. Physical exam reveals swelling of the right wrist and a warm, swollen, erythematous left knee. The left Achilles tendon is tender to palpation. There are also multiple vesicopustular lesions on the dorsum of the right hand. No penile discharge is appreciated. Arthrocentesis of the left knee is performed. Synovial fluid results are shown below:\n\nSynovial fluid:\nAppearance: Cloudy\nLeukocyte count: 40,000/mm^3 with neutrophil predominance\n\nGram stain is negative.
