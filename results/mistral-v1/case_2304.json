The girl was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. She is up to date on all vaccines and was meeting all developmental milestones until about 2 years ago. At one point she had a vocabulary of several words and now she verbalizes in grunts. She also flaps her hands in a repeated motion and has difficulty walking. Her parents have tried several home therapies to improve their daughter's symptoms including restricted diets, hydrotherapy, and a variety of nutritional supplements. The vital signs include: heart rate 90/min, respiratory rate 22/min, blood pressure 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F). On physical exam, she is well nourished and stares absently out the window. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. She has mild scoliosis.
