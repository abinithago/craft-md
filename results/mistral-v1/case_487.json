{"case_id": "case_487", "case_vignette": "A 24-year-old woman comes to her physician because of fatigue. She has been coming to the office multiple times a month for various minor problems over the past six months. During the appointments, she insists on a first name basis and flirts with her physician. She always dresses very fashionably. When his assistant enters the room, she tends to start fidgeting and interrupt their conversation. When the physician tells her politely that her behavior is inappropriate, she begins to cry, complaining that no one understands her and that if people only listened to her, she would not be so exhausted. She then quickly gathers herself and states that she will just have to keep looking for a physician who can help her, although she has doubts she will ever find the right physician. She does not have a history of self harm or suicidal ideation.
