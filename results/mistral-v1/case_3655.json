{"case_id": "case_3655", "case_vignette": "A 12-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a swollen and painful knee. He says that he was exploring with his friends when he tripped and hit his knee against the ground. He didn't feel like he hit it very hard but it started swelling and becoming very painful. His mom reports that he has always been prone to bleeding from very minor trauma and that others in the family have had similar problems. Based on clinical suspicion a coagulation panel was obtained showing a prothrombin time (PT) of 10 seconds (normal range 9-11 seconds), a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 45 seconds (normal 20-35 seconds), and a normal ristocetin cofactor assay (equivalent to bleeding time). Mixing tests with factor IX and XI do not show complementation, but mixing with factor VIII reverses the coagulation abnormality.
