{"case_id": "case_2195", "case_vignette": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his mother who is concerned about progressive leg weakness. His mother reports that the patient used to play outside with their neighbors for hours, but for the past few months she has seen him sitting on the sidewalk after 15 minutes because he\u2019s too tired. The patient says his legs are \u201csleepy.\u201d The patient\u2019s mother has also had to remove the carpets from the house because the patient kept tripping over the edges. The mother reports that the patient is shy but cooperates well with his siblings and other children. He can say his first and last name and just started counting. His mother states he learned to fully walk by 15 months of age. He was hospitalized for bronchiolitis at 12 months of age, which resolved with supportive care. He had an uncomplicated orchiopexy surgery for undescended testes at 7 months of age. He has no other chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. He is up to date on his vaccinations including a flu vaccine 2 weeks ago. The patient\u2019s mother has systemic lupus erythematous and his paternal uncle has dermatomyositis. On physical examination, bilateral calves are large in circumference compared to the thighs. Strength is 3/5 in bilateral quadriceps and 4/5 in bilateral calves. Sensation is intact. Achilles tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. The patient can hop on one leg, but gets tired after 10 jumps. He has a slight waddling gait.
