The patient has never been pregnant and previously used a copper intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception, but she had the IUD removed a year ago because it worsened her menorrhagia. She has now been using combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for nearly a year. The patient reports improvement in her menorrhagia on the OCPs but denies any improvement in her pain.
