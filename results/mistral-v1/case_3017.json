At a social function 2 days back, she met a man who introduced himself as having worked with her at another private company 3 years ago. However, she did not recognize him. She also says that she does not remember working at any such company at any time during her life. However, the patient\u2019s husband says that she had indeed worked at that company for three months and had quit due to her boss\u2019s abusive behavior towards her. The man who met her at the function had actually been her colleague at that job.  I am really not able to recall any memories of having worked at any such company. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d. Her husband adds that after she quit the job, her mood frequently has been low. The patient denies any crying episodes, suicidal ideas, not enjoying recreational activities or feelings of worthlessness. Her appetite and sleep patterns are normal. She is otherwise a healthy woman with no significant medical history and lives a normal social and occupational life. The patient reports no history of smoking, alcohol, or substance use. On physical examination, she is alert and well-oriented to time, place and person. During memory testing, she correctly remembers the date of her marriage that took place 5 years back and the food she ate over the last 2 days.
