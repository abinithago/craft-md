The patient\u2019s mother says he has been almost constantly nauseous over that time. She denies any change in his bowel habits, fever, chills, sick contacts or recent travel. The patient has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. The patient is at the 90th percentile for height and weight and has been meeting all developmental milestones. The temperature is 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109). On physical examination, the patient\u2019s abdomen is asymmetrically distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive. No lymphadenopathy is noted. A cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. Palpation of the right flank and right iliac fossa reveals a 10 \u00d7 10 cm firm mass which is immobile and tender. The laboratory findings are significant for the following: \nHemoglobin 10 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 88 \u03bcm3\nLeukocyte count 8,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 150,000/mm3\n    Serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL\nSerum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1,000 U/L\nAn ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the flank mass was performed, and the histopathologic findings are shown in the exhibit (see image).
