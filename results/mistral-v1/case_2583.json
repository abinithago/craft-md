On neurological examination, the patient has normal bilateral pupillary reflexes but a miotic left pupil. A lateral radiograph of the chest reveals a mass in the posterior mediastinum with no evidence of bone erosion. An MRI is performed and the results are shown in the image. An imaging-guided biopsy of the mass reveals spindle-shaped cells arranged chaotically, with moderate cytoplasm and small nuclei. Scattered mature ganglion cells with abundant cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei are also present. The biopsy tissue is analyzed with immunohistochemistry and found to be positive for S-100, synaptophysin, chromogranin, and leukocyte common antigen (LCA).
