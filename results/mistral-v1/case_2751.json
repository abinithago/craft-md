He can speak clearly without difficulty and denies any similar symptoms in the past. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and diabetes, both poorly managed due to medication non-compliance. Family history is significant for heart disease and diabetes in multiple paternal and maternal relatives. His vital signs include: blood pressure 150/88 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, strength is 3/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left upper and lower extremities. The sensation is intact, and no impairments in balance or ataxias are present. An initial noncontrast CT scan of the head is unremarkable, but a repeat noncontrast CT scan of the head performed a month later reveals the 2 lesions circled in the image.
