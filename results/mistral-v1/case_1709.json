{"case_id": "case_1709", "case_vignette": "A 55-year-old female patient comes to your office complaining of white spots on her tongue. She reports that she first noticed them about one week ago. She denies pain or difficulty swallowing. Her past medical history is significant for asthma, hepatitis C, and heroin abuse. She had previously been homeless and only recently went to the doctor one month ago for the first time in over five years. At that time, her primary care physician prescribed sofosbuvir, an albuterol inhaler, and daily inhaled fluticasone, which she has been using as directed. She is sexually active with one male partner. Her last HIV test was negative, and she does not have a history of sexually transmitted diseases. She denies current alcohol or intravenous drug use. She smokes a pack a day of cigarettes and reports she has been smoking since she was 16. On physical examination, you note lesions on her oral mucosa that are easily scraped off, as shown in Figure A.\n\n", "question": "Which  is the best treatment for this patient\u2019s most likely diagnosis?", "correct_ans": "nystatin suspension", "trial_0": {"multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Infectious Diseases.
