{"case_id": "case_2341", "case_vignette": "A 26-year-old woman presents to the office complaining of bloating and consistent fatigue. Past medical notes on her record show that she has seen several doctors at the clinic in the past year for the same concerns. During the discussion, she admits that coming to the doctor intensifies her anxiety and she does not enjoy it. However, she came because she fears that she has colon cancer and says, \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be something wrong with me, I can feel it.\u201d Past medical history is significant for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). She sees a therapist a few times a month. Her grandfather died of colon cancer at 75. Today, her blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, and temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals a well-nourished, well-developed woman who appears anxious and tired. Her heart has a regular rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses are palpated, and a digital rectal examination is unremarkable. Laboratory results are as follows:\nSerum chemistry \nHemoglobin 13 g/dL \nHematocrit\n38%\nMCV 90 fl\nTSH\n4.1 \u03bcU/mL\nFecal occult blood test  negative\n", "question": "Which  is the most likely diagnosis?", "correct_ans": "illness anxiety disorder", "trial_0": {"multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an AI doctor.
