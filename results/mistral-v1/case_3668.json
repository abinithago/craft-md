Her medical history is remarkable for a hospitalization during infancy for bacterial meningitis. On physical exam, the patient has difficulty looking up. The lower portion of her pupil is covered by the lower eyelid and there is sclera visible below the upper eyelid. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is shown.
