While working in his office, he fell from his chair, hit his head on a carpeted floor, and began to have generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The episode lasted approximately 3 minutes, and he felt confused afterwards. Upon interviewing the patient, he does not recall what happened prior or during the convulsive episode. He currently endorses a headache and tongue pain. He denies bowel or bladder incontinence. He reports having night sweats and an unintentional 15-pound loss over the course of 2 months. He denies any alcohol use but reports to have smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 15 years, and previously worked as a farmer. Physical examination is notable for mild left-sided weakness, bilateral tongue bites, and findings demonstrated in Figure A. A non-contrast CT scan of the head is demonstrated in Figure B.
