He also complains of increased difficulty in breathing, more so than he previously experienced. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) about 3 years ago and has been on treatment for it since then. He doesn\u2019t report any fever, chills, or night sweats. He has observed a foul smell to his sputum. His blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg, the respirations are 23/min and the pulse is about 110/min. Currently, his FEV1 is around 48% of the normal predicted value. He is currently receiving a yearly influenza shot and has taken the pneumococcal vaccination at the time of his diagnosis. In spite of this, he has had acute exacerbations of his symptoms 4 times over the last year. His last episode was 2 months ago, for which he was treated with a short course of antibiotics.
