Although she says that he had been an excellent student in high school, his grades have begun slipping in his second year in college, and he no longer socializes with friends. When she asked him why he no longer talks to his friends, she states that he told her, \u201cThey already know where I am. They can see me. They watch me from my bedroom window, so they already know what I\u2019m doing. We don\u2019t need to talk.\u201d She found this to be bizarre, as nearly all of his friends live hours away. The patient states that he feels fine and doesn\u2019t understand why everyone thinks he is crazy. The psychiatrist notices reduced spontaneous movements while the patient is speaking and that he speaks in a monotone with a voice that is soft in volume. \u201d after each evaluative question.
