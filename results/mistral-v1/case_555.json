{"case_id": "case_555", "case_vignette": "A 71-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of severe, progressive left leg pain and tingling for 8 hours. The symptoms began while he was watching television. For several months, the patient has noticed calf cramping when going for long walks, as well as occasional foot tingling and numbness, but did not seek medical attention. He has no history of recent injuries. He has poorly-controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years but quit 15 years ago. He drinks three beers every night. Current medications include lisinopril, metoprolol succinate, atorvastatin, metformin, and ibuprofen. He appears to be in severe pain and is clutching his left leg. His temperature is 37.4\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 163/94 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is a harsh II/VI systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The left leg is cool to the touch with decreased popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses. There is 5/5 strength on left hip, knee, and ankle testing. The left hip, knee, and ankle show no gross effusion, erythema, or tenderness to palpation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.
