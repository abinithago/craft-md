He states that he is embarrassed at his lack of musculature, despite lifting weights twice daily. Every day, he drinks a gallon of milk and several protein shakes in addition to 3 large meals. He is convinced that his female classmates at the community college he attends are secretly laughing at his scrawny appearance. Over the course of the semester, he has attended fewer and fewer classes out of embarrassment and shame. He is also concerned that his hair is thinning and applies topical minoxidil to his scalp 3 times daily. He spends 2 hours daily anxiously examining himself in the mirror. Today, he is wearing a long-sleeved shirt and a hat. His BMI is 26 kg/m2. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he has an anxious mood and a full range of affect.
