He had forgotten to remove his contact lenses before sleeping. Following lens removal, he experienced immediate pain, discomfort, and tearing of the left eye. He reports that the foreign body sensation persists and that rinsing with water has not improved the pain. He has been wearing contact lenses for 4 years and occasionally forgets to remove them at night. He has no history of serious medical illness. On examination, the patient appears distressed with pain and photophobia in the left eye. Administration of a topical anesthetic relieves the pain. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes. Ocular motility and pupillary response are normal. The corneal reflex is normal and symmetric in both eyes.
