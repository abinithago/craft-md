Five days ago she had a severe fever 40.0\u2103 (104.0\u2109), retro-orbital pain, nausea, and myalgias. The high temperatures decreased over a few days, but she developed severe abdominal pain and bleeding gums. A single episode of hematemesis occurred prior to ICU admission. She travels to Latin America every winter. Two weeks ago, she traveled to Brazil and spent most of her time outdoors. She is restless. The temperature is 38.0\u2103 (100.4\u2109), the pulse is 110/min, the respiration rate is 33/min, and the blood pressure is 90/70 mm Hg. Conjunctival suffusion is seen. The extremities are cold. A maculopapular rash covers the trunk and extremities. Ecchymoses are observed on the lower extremities. The lung bases reveal absent sounds with dullness to percussion. The abdomen is distended. The liver edge is palpable and liver span is 15 cm. Shifting dullness is present.
