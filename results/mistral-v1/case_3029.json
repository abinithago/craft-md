{"case_id": "case_3029", "case_vignette": "An 11-year-old boy\u2019s parents brought him to a psychologist upon referral from the boy\u2019s school teacher. The boy frequently bullies his younger classmates despite having been punished several times for this. His mother also reported that a year prior, she received complaints that the boy shoplifted from local shops in his neighborhood. The boy frequently stays out at night despite strict instructions by his parents to return home by 10 PM. Detailed history reveals that apart from such behavior, he is usually not angry or irritable. Although his abnormal behavior continues despite warnings and punishments, he neither argues with his parents nor teachers and does not display verbal or physical aggression.
