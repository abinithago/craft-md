{"case_id": "case_2845", "case_vignette": "A 50-year-old female teacher presents to the clinic with complaints of discoloration of the skin around the right ankle accompanied by itching. She began noticing it a month ago and the pruritus worsened over time. She also has some pain and swelling of the region every night, especially on days when she teaches late into the evening. Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, for which she takes metformin. She lives with her husband and takes oral contraceptive pills. On examination, the physician observes hyperpigmentation of the medial aspect of her right ankle. The skin is dry, scaly, and edematous along with some superficial varicosities. Dorsiflexion of the foot is extremely painful. Peripheral pulses are equally palpable on both lower limbs. There is a small 2 cm ulcer noted near the medial malleolus with thickened neighboring skin and indurated edges. Laboratory studies show D-dimer of 1,000 \u00b5g/L and HbA1c of 9%. Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremity reveals an intramural thrombus in the popliteal vein.
