The pain began soon after she entered a theater to watch a movie. She has a headache and vomited twice on the way to the hospital. Two weeks ago, she had acute sinusitis that resolved spontaneously. She has atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Current medications include metoprolol and warfarin. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg. Visual acuity is counting fingers at 3 feet in the left eye and 20/20 in the right eye. The left eye shows conjunctival injection and edematous cornea. The left pupil is mid-dilated and irregular; it is not reactive to light. Extraocular movements are normal. Fundoscopic examination is inconclusive because of severe corneal edema.
