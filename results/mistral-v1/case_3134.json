He states that he was diagnosed with emphysema 4 years ago and that, over the past several months, he has developed a chronic productive cough, dyspnea, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and night sweats. He notes that he also has other complaints aside from his lung problems, including sharp, intermittent chest pain and joint pain in his elbows and knees. There is also an erythematous rash on both the lower extremities that features raised lesions; it is determined to be erythema nodosum. Cardiac examination reveals a friction rub, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest reveals cavitation of both lung apices. The patient is isolated for the suspicion of active tuberculosis (TB) infection. A purified protein derivative (PPD) test is negative. Sputum sample staining fails to reveal acid-fast bacilli, but it does reveal yeast forms that are replicating by narrow-based budding.
