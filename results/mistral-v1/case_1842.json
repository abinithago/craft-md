{"case_id": "case_1842", "case_vignette": "A 15-year-old girl is brought into her pediatrician's office by her mother because the mother thinks her daughter has attention issues. The mother explains that her daughter started high school four months ago and had lackluster grades in a recent progress report despite having earned consistent top marks in middle school. The mother complains that her daughter never talks to her at home anymore. The patient yells at her mother in the exam room, and the mother is escorted out of the room. The patient scoffs that her mother is so overbeaing, ruining her good days with criticism. She begins to chew gum and states that she hates hanging out with the girls on the cheerleading squad. She denies experiencing physical abuse from anyone or having a sexual partner. She has seen kids smoke marijuana underneath the football field bleachers, but does not go near them and denies smoking cigarettes. She denies any intention to harm herself or others, thinks her grades went down because her teachers are not as good as her middle school teachers, and states she thinks she learns best by watching explanations through online videos.
