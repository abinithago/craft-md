{"case_id": "case_3136", "case_vignette": "A 62-year-old woman has been receiving amoxicillin for acute sinusitis for 12 days. She develops a macular rash on her neck, back, and torso. The amoxicillin is therefore changed to cephalexin for an additional week. The rash resolves, but she returns complaining of fatigue, flank pain, and fever that has persisted despite the resolution of the sinusitis. She has a history of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastric reflux. She has been on a stable regimen of lisinopril, simvastatin, and omeprazole. Today, her vital signs reveal: temperature 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 145/90 mm Hg, regular pulse 75/min, and respirations 16/min. The physical examination is unremarkable. Serum urea and creatinine are elevated. Urinalysis shows leukocyturia, but urine bacterial culture is negative. A urine cytospin stained with Hansel\u2019s solution reveals 3% binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm.
