{"case_id": "case_430", "case_vignette": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of sadness that started 6 weeks after her 9-month-old daughter was born. Since then, she has not returned to work. Her daughter usually sleeps through the night, but the patient still has difficulty staying asleep. She is easily distracted from normal daily tasks. She used to enjoy cooking, but only orders delivery or take-out now. She says that she always feels too exhausted to do so and does not feel hungry much anyway. The pregnancy of the patient's child was complicated by gestational diabetes. The child was born at 36-weeks' gestation and has had no medical issues. The patient has no contact with the child's father. She is not sexually active. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is 157 cm (5 ft 1 in) tall and weighs 47 kg (105 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is alert and cooperative but makes little eye contact.
