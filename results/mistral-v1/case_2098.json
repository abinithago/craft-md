A similar rash occurred last year, which improved with a topical cream he purchased over the counter, but he does not remember the name. The patient has a history of attention deficient disorder and atopic dermatitis. His medications include methylphenidate and betamethasone. The patient has been a wrestler since high school and currently wrestles for the university. He reports he is doing well in his classes. He admits to smoking marijuana recreationally and having a few beers on the weekends with his friends. He went to Costa Rica for a 2-week mission trip 6 months ago. Physical exam reveals a lesion as shown in Figure A. Potassium hydroxide scrapings of the lesion confirm the diagnosis.
