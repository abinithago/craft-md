On physical examination, the patient is ill-appearing with pallor and bilateral pitting edema of legs. The apex beat is prominently located in the 5th intercostal space in the mid-axillary line. Crepitus is noted over both lung bases bilaterally. A loud 3/6 pansystolic murmur is heard at the apex radiating towards the axilla. S3 and S4 sounds are noted at the left sternal border and cardiac apex.
