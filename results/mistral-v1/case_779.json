{"case_id": "case_779", "case_vignette": "Three days after undergoing open surgery to repair a bilateral inguinal hernia, a 66-year-old man has new, intermittent upper abdominal discomfort that worsens when he walks around. He also has new shortness of breath that resolves with rest. There were no complications during surgery or during the immediate postsurgical period. Ambulation was restarted on the first postoperative day. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years. Prior to admission, his medications included metformin, simvastatin, and lisinopril. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 129/80 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. The abdomen is soft and shows two healing surgical scars with moderate serous discharge. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG at rest shows no abnormalities. Cardiac enzyme levels are within the reference range. An x-ray of the chest and abdominal ultrasonography show no abnormalities.
