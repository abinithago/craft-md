She denies that anyone in the household is exhibiting similar symptoms, but does recall a note that came home from school warning of a lice outbreak. Thus far, she has only tried daily baths with little improvement. The patient denies pain or itchiness, but the mother reports she does notice him scratching his scalp. The mother also reports that since her son has started at the new school, she has noticed an increase in his tics including excessive blinking and clearing of his throat.

His current medications include fluticasone, salmeterol, loratadine, and methylphenidate. Family history includes obsessive compulsive disorder in his older sister. The mother also reports her father had a debilitating skin and joint disorder.
