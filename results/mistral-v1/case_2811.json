Physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate of 80/min, and temperature of 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u2109).

Laboratory investigation reveals low blood glucose and pH with high lactate, triglycerides, ketones, and free fatty acids. The liver biopsy revealed high glycogen content. Hepatic glycogen structure was normal. The enzyme assay performed on the biopsy tissue revealed very low glucose-6-phosphatase levels.
