{"case_id": "case_2896", "case_vignette": "A 27-year-old woman is brought to the office at the insistence of her fianc\u00e9 to be evaluated for auditory hallucinations for the past 8 months. The patient\u2019s fianc\u00e9 tells the physician that the patient often mentions that she can hear her own thoughts speaking aloud to her. The hallucinations have occurred intermittently for at least 1-month periods. Past medical history is significant for hypertension. Her medications include lisinopril and a daily multivitamin both of which she frequently neglects. She lost her security job 7 months ago after failing to report to work on time. The patient\u2019s vital signs include: blood pressure 132/82 mm Hg; pulse 72/min; respiratory rate 18/min, and temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient has a flat affect and her focus fluctuates from the window to the door. She is disheveled with a foul smell. She has difficulty focusing on the discussion and does not quite understand what is happening around her. A urine toxicology screen is negative.
