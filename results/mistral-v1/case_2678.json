{"case_id": "case_2678", "case_vignette": "A 46-year-old man presents to the clinic with a 2-week history of fever, fatigue, and coughing up blood. On questioning, he notes that he has also experienced some weight loss over the past 4 months and a change in the color of his urine, with intermittent passage of dark-colored urine during that time. The man does not have a prior history of cough or hemoptysis and has not been in contact with anyone with a chronic cough. The cough was originally productive of rust-colored sputum, but it has now progressed to the coughing up of blood and sputum at least twice daily. Sputum production is approximately 2 spoonfuls per coughing episode. Vital signs include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), respiratory rate 42/min, and pulse 88/min. Physical examination reveals an anxious but tired-looking man with mild respiratory distress and mild pallor. Laboratory and antibody tests are ordered and the findings include the following:\nLaboratory test\nHematocrit 34%\nHepatitis antibody test negative\nHepatitis C antibody test negative\n24-hour urinary protein 2 g\nUrine microscopy more than 5 RBC under high power microscopy\nAntibody test\nC-ANCA negative\nAnti MPO/P-ANCA positive\nSerum urea 140 mg/dL\nSerum creatinine 2.8 mg/dL\nRenal biopsy shows glomerulonephritis with crescent formation.
