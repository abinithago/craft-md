{"case_id": "case_493", "case_vignette": "A 74-year-old Hispanic man comes to the physician because of a three-week history of dizziness upon standing and a brief loss of consciousness one hour ago. The patient suddenly collapsed on his way to the bathroom after waking up in the morning. He did not sustain any injuries from his collapse. He has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and gout. The patient's mother died of a grand mal seizure at the age of 53 years.
