Three weeks ago, he had an acute arterial embolism that could not be revascularized in time to save the leg. He now reports episodic hot, shooting, and tingling pain in the right lower leg that began shortly after the amputation. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. His current medications are metformin and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a slightly erythematous stump with clean sutures. The skin overlying the stump is warm and well-perfused. Muscle strength and sensation are normal throughout the remaining extremity and the left lower extremity.
