{"case_id": "case_2987", "case_vignette": "A 55-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with a 2-month history of insidious onset of left shoulder pain. It only occurs at the extremes of her range of motion and has made it difficult to sleep on the affected side. She has noticed increasing difficulty with activities of daily living, including brushing her hair and putting on or taking off her blouse and bra. She denies a history of shoulder trauma, neck pain, arm/hand weakness, numbness, or paresthesias. Her medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which she takes metformin and glipizide. Her physical examination reveals a marked decrease in both active and passive range of motion of the left shoulder, with forwarding flexion to 75\u00b0, abduction to 75\u00b0, external rotation to 45\u00b0, and internal rotation to 15\u00b0 with significant pain. Rotator cuff strength is normal. AP, scapular Y, and axillary plain film radiographs are reported as normal.
