{"case_id": "case_2416", "case_vignette": "A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of smelling abnormal odors on several occasions. He says that he smells burnt rubber even though there is nothing burning and no one around him can smell what he does. This symptom has been intermittently bothering him for the past 6 months. Also during this period, he had occasional nosebleeds. He works as a high school teacher. Although his work gets a little stressful around the exam season, he says he is able to cope well. Family history is unremarkable. He does not smoke or drink alcohol and denies the use of any medication. Physical examination reveals unilateral nasal obstruction with some dried blood in the nasal passage.
