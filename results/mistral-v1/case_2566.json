{"case_id": "case_2566", "case_vignette": "A 13-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents for 5 days of abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and mild diarrhea. Her parents have been giving her acetaminophen in the past 3 days, which they stopped 24 hours ago when they noted blood in their daughter's urine. Upon admission, the patient has a fever of 39.6\u00b0C (103.3\u00b0F) and is hemodynamically stable. While waiting for the results of the laboratory tests, the patient develops intense left flank pain, and nausea and vomiting intensifies. Her condition rapidly deteriorates with an abnormally high blood pressure of 180/100 mm Hg, a heart rate of 120/min, and labored breathing leading to ventilatory failure. Under these conditions, the ER team immediately transfers the patient to the pediatric ICU, however, the patient dies shortly after.
