{"case_id": "case_2325", "case_vignette": "A 3-year-old boy presents to the office with his mother. She states that her son seems weak and unwilling to walk. He only learned how to walk recently after a very notable delay. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all verbal and social milestones but he has a great deal of trouble with gross and fine motor skills. Past medical history is noncontributory. He takes a multivitamin every day. The mother states that some boys on her side of the family have had similar symptoms and worries that her son might have the same condition. Today, the boy\u2019s vital signs include: blood pressure 110/65 mm Hg, heart rate 90/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical exam, the boy appears well developed and pleasant. He sits and listens and follows direction. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. He struggles to get up to a standing position after sitting on the floor. A genetic study is performed that reveals a significant deletion in the gene that codes for dystrophin.
