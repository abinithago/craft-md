{"case_id": "case_2188", "case_vignette": "A 65-year-old man is referred by his primary care provider to a neurologist for leg pain. He reports a 6-month history of progressive bilateral lower extremity pain that is worse in his left leg. The pain is 5/10 in severity at its worst and is described as a \"burning\" pain. He has noticed that the pain is acutely worse when he walks downhill. He has started riding his stationary bike more often as it relieves his pain. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a prior myocardial infarction. He also sustained a distal radius fracture the previous year after falling on his outstretched hand. He takes aspirin, atorvastatin, metformin, glyburide, enalapril, and metoprolol. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history and drinks 2-3 glasses of wine with dinner every night. His temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 91/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. A straight leg raise is negative. A valsalva maneuver does not worsen his pain.
