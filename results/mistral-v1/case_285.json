{"case_id": "case_285", "case_vignette": "A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-year history of progressively worsening pain in her knees and fingers. The knee pain is worse when she walks for longer than 30 minutes. When she wakes up in the morning, her fingers and knees are stiff for about 15 minutes. She cannot recall any trauma to the joints. She was treated with amoxicillin following a tick bite 2 years ago. She is otherwise healthy and only takes a multivitamin and occasionally acetaminophen for the pain. She drinks 1\u20132 glasses of wine daily. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (174 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 133/78 mm Hg. Examination of the lower extremities reveals mild genu varum. Range of motion of both knees is limited; there is palpable crepitus. Complete flexion and extension elicit pain. Tender nodules are present on the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the index, ring, and little fingers bilaterally.
