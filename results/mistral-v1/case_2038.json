The patient has a past medical history of surgical repair of his Achilles tendon, ACL, and medial meniscus. He is currently not taking any medications. The patient lives with his wife and they both practice a vegan lifestyle. On physical exam the patient states that he is currently not experiencing any pain in his foot but rather is experiencing numbness/tingling along the plantar surface of his foot.
