The patient has a past medical history of poorly managed diabetes, constipation, anxiety, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 197/128 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam reveals a systolic murmur heard loudest along the left upper sternal border. Abdominal exam reveals an obese, tympanitic and distended abdomen with a 3 cm scar in the right lower quadrant. Vascular exam reveals weak pulses in the lower extremities.
