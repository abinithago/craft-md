Her blood pressure is 134/87 mm Hg, the heart rate is 70/min, and the temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F). The exam is occasionally disrupted by sudden episodic jerking of her limbs. She is drowsy but arousable to voice, and is disoriented and confused. Extraocular movements are normal. Cranial nerves are intact. There is no neck stiffness. Her laboratory results are significant for:\nHemoglobin 14.3 g/dL\nWhite blood cells 6,900/mm3\nPlatelets 347,000/mm3\nCreatinine 1.0 mg/dL\nSodium 146 mmol/L\nPotassium 4.1 mEq/L\nCalcium 9.1 mg/dL\nGlucose (random) 132 mg/dL\nTSH 2.5 mU/L\nShe is admitted to the neurology service. A head MRI, lumbar puncture, and EEG are performed. The MRI is nondiagnostic. Electroencephalography (EEG) reveals periodic spike and slow waves at an interval of 1 second.
