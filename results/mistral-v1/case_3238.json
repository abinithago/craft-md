{"case_id": "case_3238", "case_vignette": "A 51-year-old man alcoholic presents to the emergency department with persistent vomiting. He was found vomiting forcefully next to an empty bottle of vodka. His medical history is significant for Lyme disease, currently being treated with doxycycline. After a prolonged episode of retching, the patient begins choking and coughing forcefully in between bouts of chest pain in the ER. At this point, the patient is unable to communicate. The patient appears toxic. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 90/68 mm Hg. A quick physical exam reveals fullness at the base of the neck and a crunching, rasping sound on auscultation of the chest. The attending physician orders an upright chest X-ray, showing free mediastinal air.
