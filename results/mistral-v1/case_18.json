{"case_id": "case_18", "case_vignette": "A 38-year-old African American woman was referred to dermatology because of spots on her torso and arms. The lesions were asymptomatic, but their development, cause, and cosmesis were of concern. No benefit was seen with the use of OTC remedies such as hydroxycortisone 1% cream or vitamin E oil. Her medical history was significant for systemic lupus erythematosus, well controlled on hydroxychloroquine. Physical examination revealed numerous, well-circumscribed, 0.5- to 2-cm, hypopigmented, round-to-oval macules of wrinkled skin on her anterior chest wall, back, abdomen, and bilateral upper arms. Invagination of the lesions was noted with palpation. A punch biopsy was performed.", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "correct_ans": "anetoderma associated with sle", "trial_0": {"multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
