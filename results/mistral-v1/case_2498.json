{"case_id": "case_2498", "case_vignette": "During a humanitarian medical mission in rural Vietnam, a medical resident encounters a 50-year-old man with a year-long history of a pruritic rash on his upper body and face, along with numbness and tingling sensation of both of his palms. He mostly works on his family\u2019s rice farm, where he also takes care of livestock. A physical examination revealed multiple erythematous macules and papules on the face, arms, chest, and back, as well as thinning of the eyebrows and loss of some eyelashes. Additional findings include hypopigmented macules around the elbows, which are insensitive to light touch, temperature, and pinprick. The grip strength is slightly diminished bilaterally with the conservation of both bicipital reflexes.
