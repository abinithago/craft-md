{"case_id": "case_797", "case_vignette": "A 7-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has been increasingly reluctant to speak at school over the past 4 months. Her teachers complain that she does not answer their questions and it is affecting her academic performance. She was born at 35 weeks' gestation and pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia. Previous well-child examinations have been normal. Her older brother was diagnosed with a learning disability 4 years ago. She is at 65th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. She follows commands. She avoids answering questions directly and whispers her answers to her mother instead who then mediates between the doctor and her daughter.
