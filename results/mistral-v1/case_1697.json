She states she has not had any illnesses last year and is on her school's volleyball team. She exercises daily, does not use any drugs, and has never smoked cigarettes. On physical exam you note bruising around the patients neck, and what seems to be burn marks on her back and thighs. The physician inquires about these marks. The patient explains that these marks are the result of her sexual activities. She states that in order for her to be aroused she has to engage in acts such as hitting, choking, or anything else that she can think of. The physician learns that the patient lives with her boyfriend and that she is in a very committed relationship. She is currently monogamous with this partner. The patient is studying with the hopes of going to law school and is currently working in a coffee shop. The rest of the patient\u2019s history and physical is unremarkable.
