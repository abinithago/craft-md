{"case_id": "case_2086", "case_vignette": "A 31-year-old gravida 2 para 2 woman presents to her primary care physician for follow up. Two weeks ago, she gave birth via vaginal delivery to a 9.5 lb (4.3 kg) male infant. The delivery was complicated by a vaginal laceration that required extensive suturing once the infant was delivered. Immediately after delivery of the placenta she experienced intense shaking and chills that resolved within 1 hour. She has felt well since the delivery but admits to 6 days of malodorous smelling vaginal discharge that is tan in color. She has a history of vaginal candidiasis and is worried that it may be recurring. Her temperature is 98.8\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 122/73 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, respirations are 16/min, and BMI is 33 kg/m^2.
