The incontinence occurs during both day and night and is not related to physical exertion. She denies urgency, incomplete voiding, painful urination, or any other genitourinary symptoms.

On physical examination, there is no costovertebral or suprapubic tenderness. The surgical scar is normal in appearance. The gynecologic examination revealed a small opening in the upper portion of the anterior wall of the vagina. No discharge was noted.
