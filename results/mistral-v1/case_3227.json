The patient takes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. Her parents are both deceased. She does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, she described a month-long trip to St. Louis, Missouri, to visit family. At the physician\u2019s office, her temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild crepitus on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a cavitary lesion in the right lung which is confirmed on chest computed tomography (CT). A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with oval yeast in macrophages.
