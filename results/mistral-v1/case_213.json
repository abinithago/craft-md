He reports having a sore throat 3 weeks ago while he was camping in the woods, for which he received symptomatic treatment. His immunizations are up-to-date. His temperature is 38.7\u00b0C (101.6\u00b0F), pulse is 119/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Examination shows a swollen, tender right knee; range of motion is limited. There are painless 3- to 4-mm nodules over the elbow. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal. His hemoglobin concentration is 12.3 g/dL, leukocyte count is 11,800/mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 58 mm/h. Arthrocentesis of the right knee joint yields clear, straw-colored fluid; no organisms are identified on Gram stain. Analysis of the synovial fluid shows a leukocyte count of 1,350/mm3 with 17% neutrophils.
