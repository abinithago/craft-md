Her temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and her blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Auscultation of her lungs shows diffuse wheezing over bilateral lung fields. Physical examination shows tender subcutaneous nodules on the extensor surfaces of the elbows. There are palpable, non-blanching erythematous lesions on both shins. Dorsiflexion of the right foot is impaired. Sensation to pinprick, light touch, and vibration is decreased over the ulnar aspect of the left forearm.
