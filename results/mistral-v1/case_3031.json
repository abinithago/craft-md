{"case_id": "case_3031", "case_vignette": "A 35-year-old man presents with acute onset of chest pain, trouble breathing, and abdominal pain. He says he had recently been training for a triathlon competition when, over the past week, he noticed that he was getting more tired than usual. He figured that it was due to his age since most of the people training with him were in their 20s. However, after completing a particularly difficult workout over this last weekend he noticed left-sided chest pain that did not radiate, and abdominal pain, worse on the right side. The pain persisted after he stopped exercising. This morning he noticed red urine. The patient reports similar past episodes of red urine after intense exercise or excessive alcohol intake for the past 5 years, but says it has never been accompanied by pain. Past medical history is significant for a urinary tract infection last week, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Physical examination is significant for a systolic flow murmur loudest at the right upper sternal border and right upper quadrant tenderness without guarding or rebound. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nHemoglobin 8.5 g/dL\nPlatelets 133,000/\u00b5L\nTotal bilirubin 6.8 mg/dL\nLDH 740 U/L\nHaptoglobin 25 mg/dL\nAn abdominal MRI with contrast is performed which reveals hepatic vein thrombosis.
