Both his past medical history and family history are insignificant. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes a day since the age of 20 and drinks wine every night before bed. His vitals are: heart rate of 78/min, respiratory rate of 14/min, temperature of 36.5\u00b0C (97.8\u00b0F), blood pressure of 140/88 mm Hg. An indirect laryngoscopy reveals a rough vegetating lesion on the free border of the right vocal cord.
