{"case_id": "case_3189", "case_vignette": "A 65-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck over the past week. He also has noted severe night sweats, which require a change of clothes and bed linens the next day. His medical history is significant for long-standing hypertension. He received a kidney transplant 6 years ago. His current medications include amlodipine, metoprolol, furosemide, aspirin, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate. His family history is significant for his sister, who died last year from lymphoma. A review of systems is positive for a 6-kg (13.2-lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. His vital signs include: temperature 37.8\u2103 (100.0\u2109) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple painless lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is palpated on the right side. Abdominal examination is significant for a spleen of 16 cm below the cost margin on percussion. Laboratory studies are significant for the following:\nHemoglobin 9 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 88 \u03bcm3\nLeukocyte count 12,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 130,000/mm3\nCreatinine 1.1 mg/dL\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1 000 U/L\nA peripheral blood smear is unremarkable.
