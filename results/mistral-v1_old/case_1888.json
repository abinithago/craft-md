{"case_id": "case_1888", "case_vignette": "A 54-year-old African American man presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. He was at home watching television when his symptoms began. He has a past medical history of COPD, alcohol abuse, diabetes, asthma, obesity, pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and hypertension. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history as well. His current medications include albuterol, insulin, nicotine patches, duloxetine, hydroxyurea, and lisinopril. Chest radiography confirms the diagnosis of a spontaneous pneumothorax. A chest tube is placed, and the patient is transferred to the medical floor. Laboratory results are ordered and are seen below:\n\nHemoglobin: 9 g/dL\nPlatelet count: 180,000/mm^3\nMean corpuscular volume: 125 \u00b5m^3\nReticulocyte count: 0.3%\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 102 mEq/L\nK+: 4.2 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 133 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.4 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.2 mg/dL\nVitamin B12: 197 ng/L\nAST: 22 U/L\nALT: 10 U/L\nTroponins: undetectable\n\nOn the medical floor, the patient complains of continued fatigue and minor chest pain. A peripheral smear is ordered as seen in Figure A. An EKG is ordered and demonstrates a right bundle branch block which is unchanged from previous EKGs.
