She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. Vital signs are 99.6\u00b0F (37.6\u00b0F), blood pressure is 134/82 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. Examination demonstrates a rash on the patient's face that spares the nasolabial folds along with oral ulcers. The metacarpophalangeal joints are tender to palpation, and range of motion is limited by pain. Complete blood count demonstrates normocytic anemia with thrombocytopenia.
