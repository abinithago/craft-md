She was seated and was being tattooed on her right upper flank when she became diaphoretic, pale, and passed out. According to her boyfriend, the patient slipped to the floor and her arms and legs moved in a jerky fashion for a few seconds. She regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately. She has no history of serious illness. She works as an event manager and has had more stress than usual due to a recent concert tour. She appears well. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 120/72 mm Hg. Her cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block.
