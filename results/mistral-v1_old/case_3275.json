A peripheral blood smear shows teardrop-shaped and nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) and immature myeloid cells. The marrow is very difficult to aspirate but reveals hyperplasia of all 3 lineages. The tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test is negative. Clonal marrow plasma cells are not seen. JAK-2 is positive.
