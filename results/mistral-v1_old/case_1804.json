{"case_id": "case_1804", "case_vignette": "A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not \u201ckeeping up\u201d with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time.
