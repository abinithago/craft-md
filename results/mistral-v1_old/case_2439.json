Upon arrival to the hospital her heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, and temperature of 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F).

While attempting to take her blood pressure, the patient\u2019s arm and hand flex sharply and do not relax until the cuff is released. A light tap on the cheek results in an atypical facial muscle twitch. A CMP and CBC are drawn and sent for analysis.
