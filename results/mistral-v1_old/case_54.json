{"case_id": "case_54", "case_vignette": "A 43-year-old elementary school teacher presents with a rash that began on his left thigh approximately 4 months earlier; the rash has since spread.

Suspecting eczema, he has been applying an over-the-counter hydrocortisone 1% cream as well as a moisturizer, which transiently alleviates the itch. He has not changed laundry or hygiene products.
