The patient\u2019s weight was normal at birth, but he suffered from a failure to thrive, although there was no neonatal history of chronic diarrhea or jaundice. His current vitals are a respiratory rate of 26/min, a pulse of 96/min, a temperature of 38.8\u2103 (101.8\u00b0F), a blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. On physical examination, there is coarse crepitus bilaterally and both expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is present. The chest radiograph shows evidence of diffuse emphysema. A sweat chloride test and nitro tetrazolium test are both within normal limits.
