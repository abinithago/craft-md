The patient reports that he was in his usual state of health until 1 month ago, when he developed a cold. Since then his cold has improved, but he continues to have a cough and worsening asthma symptoms. He says that he has been using his rescue inhaler 3 times a day with little improvement. He is studying for an accounting exam and states that his asthma is keeping him up at night and making it hard for him to focus during the day. The patient admits to smoking tobacco. His smoking has increased from a half pack per day since he was 17 years old to 1 pack per day during the past month to cope with the stress of his exam. The patient\u2019s temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/74 mmHg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 15/min with an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.
