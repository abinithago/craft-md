{"case_id": "case_569", "case_vignette": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 12.5 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 8400/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 80%\nEosinophils 1%\nLymphocytes 17%\nMonocytes 2%\nCD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL\nPlatelet count 328,000/mm3\nAn MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA.
