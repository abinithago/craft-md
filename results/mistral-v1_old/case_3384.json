Prior to this year, he was generally an outgoing and social young man, who now reportedly has been spending the majority of his time alone in his dorm room and room at home, where his mother and father have overheard him talking to other people when he has no guests. When asked if anything was bothering him at school, he reports that at night the voice of the school's mascot encourages him to save the school from the large oak grove that will soon takeover the student union building by setting the trees on fire for all to see.
