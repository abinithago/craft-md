Her pulse rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 150/70 mm Hg. An irregularly irregular rhythm is heard on auscultation of the heart. Neck examination shows a markedly enlarged thyroid with no lymphadenopathy or bruit. Laboratory tests show low serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, high T4 level, absent thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, and absent anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody. Nuclear scintigraphy shows patchy uptake with multiple hot and cold areas.
