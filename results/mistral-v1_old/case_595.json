The patient's older brother underwent surgery for pyloric stenosis as an infant. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epicanthus, upward slanting of the eyelids, low-set ears, and a single transverse palmar crease. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur is heard at the left mid to lower sternal border. Abdominal examination shows a distended upper abdomen and a concave-shaped lower abdomen. There is no organomegaly.
