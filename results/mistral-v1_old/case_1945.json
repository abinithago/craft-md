He asserts that the pain is instigated by walking up and down stairs around a construction site which he oversees. On physical exam, his hips are symmetric and equal with no tenderness to palpation bilaterally. His left lower extremity appears grossly normal with full range of motion. His right knee appears symmetric, but the patient whimpers when the anteromedial part of the tibial plateau is pressed. No other parts of his knee are tender. No tenderness is elicited with extension, flexion, varus, and valgus movements of the knee. McMurray's test is negative with both internal and external rotation of the right leg.
