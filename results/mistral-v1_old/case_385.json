Current medications include hydroxyurea and acetaminophen as needed for the ankle pain. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), blood pressure is 125/68 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 14/min. Examination shows a tender, swollen, and erythematous right ankle with point tenderness over the medial malleolus. X-ray of the right ankle demonstrates marked periosteal thickening and elevation, as well as a central sclerotic lesion with a lucent rim over the right lateral malleolus.
