His temperature is 37.6\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. The patient seems anxious and refuses a physical examination of his chest. His cardiac troponin I concentration is 0.01 ng/mL (N = 0\u20130.01). An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes. While the physician is planning to discharge the patient, the patient reports numbness in his arm and insists on being admitted to the ward. On the following day, the patient leaves the hospital without informing the physician or the nursing staff.
