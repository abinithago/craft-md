The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. Past medical history is noncontributory. The family recently made a trip to India to visit relatives. Today, his heart rate is 100/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, blood pressure is 105/65 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.2\u00baC (99.0\u00b0F). On physical examination, he appears unwell with poor skin turgor and dry oral mucosa. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is sensitive to shallow and deep palpation. A gross examination of the stool reveals a \u2018rice water\u2019 appearance. Diagnostic microbiology results are pending.
