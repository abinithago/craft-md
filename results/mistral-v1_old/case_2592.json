His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F),  pulse is 72/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 136/84 mm Hg. A physical examination is notable for a dry mouth with red mucosa and no distinct plaques or patches, and a supple neck with no masses or cervical lymphadenopathy. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy shows small white patches within the esophageal lumen. A biopsy of one of the lesions is performed and the microscopic appearance of the finding is shown below.
