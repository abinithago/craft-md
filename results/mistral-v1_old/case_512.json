Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of placental abruption. Current medications include iron and vitamin supplements. Her immunizations are up-to-date. Her temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 122/min, and blood pressure is 110/78 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows severe, diffuse tenderness throughout the lower quadrants. Speculum examination confirms rupture of membranes with drainage of malodorous, blood-tinged fluid. Ultrasonography shows the fetus in a cephalic presentation. The fetal heart rate is 175/min and reactive with no decelerations.
