The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension and she is currently taking insulin, metformin, lisinopril, and oral contraceptive pills. Her temperature is 104\u00b0F (40.0\u00b0C), blood pressure is 157/93 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Upon further inspection, the patient also demonstrates exophthalmos in the affected eye. The patient's extraocular movements are notably decreased in the affected eye with reduced vertical and horizontal gaze. The patient also demonstrates decreased sensation near the affected eye in the distribution of V1 and V2.
