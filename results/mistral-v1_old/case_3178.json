The patient\u2019s roommate says that the patient has been looking for cameras that aliens planted in their apartment for the past 2 weeks. Approximately 3 months prior to the onset of this episode, the roommate says the patient stopped playing basketball daily because the sport no longer interested him. He stayed in his bedroom most of the day and was often tearful. The roommate recalls the patient talking about death frequently. The patient states he has been skipping many meals and has lost a significant amount of weight as a result. At the time his delusions about the aliens began, the depressive-related symptoms were no longer present. He has no other medical conditions. He does not drink but smokes 2 packs of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years. His vitals include: blood pressure 130/88 mm Hg, pulse 92/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient seems apathetic and uses an obscure word that appears to be \u2018chinterfittle\u2019. His affect is flat throughout the entire interaction. He is experiencing bizarre delusions but no hallucinations. The patient does not express suicidal or homicidal ideations.
