She had similar episodes 2 months and 5 months ago. The mother also states that, for the past 8 months, the patient has believed she is a famous singer and is going on a world tour next year. The patient does not have a partner and has only a few friends. She was working as a dental technician until 6 months ago, when she started to hear voices telling her to quit. She has not held a job since then. She does not use illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, her speech is pressured, but she suddenly stops talking in the middle of sentences and does not finish them. She occasionally directs her attention to empty corners in the room, as if she were listening to someone.
