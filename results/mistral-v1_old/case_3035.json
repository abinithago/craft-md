The patient\u2019s mother mentions that his academic performance was excellent in kindergarten and first grade, but his second and third-grade teachers complain that he is extremely talkative, does not complete schoolwork, and frequently makes careless mistakes. They also complain that he frequently looks at other students or outside the window during the class and is often lost during the lessons. At home, he is very talkative and disorganized. When the pediatrician asks the boy his name, he replies promptly. He was born at full term by spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up-to-date on all vaccinations and has met all developmental milestones on time. A recent IQ test scored him at 95. His physical examination is completely normal. When he is asked to read from an age-appropriate children\u2019s book, he reads it fluently and correctly.
