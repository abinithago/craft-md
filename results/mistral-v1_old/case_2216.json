The patient works as a school teacher in Alaska and regularly goes hiking and camping. She recently returned from a camping trip where she hiked through tall brush and drank from mountain streams. The patient was also involved in a motor vehicle accident 2 days ago but did not seek treatment. The patient has a medical history that is unremarkable and is currently taking multivitamins and other than a recent bout of diarrhea is generally healthy. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a very anxious woman with 1/5 strength of the patient\u2019s lower extremities and 2/5 strength of her trunk muscles with diminished sensation.
