A 24-hour urine collection shows increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration.

A diagnosis of an inoperable disease is made and the patient is started on treatment with octreotide. Six weeks later, the patient's symptoms have improved except for his abdominal pain and frequent loose stools.
