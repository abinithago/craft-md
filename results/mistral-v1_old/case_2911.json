The patient states that she noticed that an area of her left breast felt thicker than before, and has not improved. She came to get it checked out because her best friend was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. The past medical history is significant for Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, well-managed medically with levothyroxine. The patient has a 30-pack-year smoking history, but she quit over 15 years ago. The menarche occurred at age 11, and the menopause was at age 53. She does not have any children and has never been sexually active. Her last screening mammogram 10 months ago was normal. The family history is significant for her mother dying from a myocardial infarction (MI) at age 68, her sister dying from metastatic breast cancer at age 55, and for colon cancer in her paternal grandfather. The review of systems is notable for unintentional weight loss of 3.6 kg (8 lb) in the past month. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u2103 (98.6\u2109), blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The physical examination is significant only for a minimally palpable mass with irregular, poorly defined margins in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. The mass is rubbery and movable. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy noted.
