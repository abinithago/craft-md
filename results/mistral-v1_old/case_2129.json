{"case_id": "case_2129", "case_vignette": "A 26-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a routine physical exam. He is concerned about a burning sensation that he feels in his throat whenever he eats large meals and is concerned he may have esophageal cancer like his uncle. The patient has a past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. His current medications include whey protein supplements, fish oil, a multivitamin, and sodium docusate. The patient is concerned about his performance in school and fears he may fail out. He recently did poorly on an exam and it has caused him significant stress. He also is worried that his girlfriend is going to leave him. The patient claims that he thought he was going to be an incredible doctor some day, but now he feels like a terrible person. The patient also states that he feels guilty about his grandfather's death which occurred 1 year ago and he often reexperiences the funeral in his mind. He regularly has trouble sleeping for which he takes melatonin. The patient has been praying every 4 hours with the hopes that this will make things go better for him.
