He has no complaints or concerns but, on further questioning, does have some vague abdominal discomfort. He has no known past medical history and takes no medications. His social history is notable for injecting heroin throughout his late-teens and 20s, but he has been clean and sober for over a decade. At the clinic, the vital signs include: heart rate 90/min, respiratory rate 17/min, blood pressure 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). The physical exam shows a slightly distended abdomen. The laboratory studies are notable for a platelet count of 77,000/uL and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.7.
