His heart has a regular rhythm, and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative. During the examination, he avoids eye contact and appears detached. When asked about his social life, he claims that he does not care about making friends and prefers to be alone. He says he enjoys going to the movies, but he enjoys doing this alone. He has not had a romantic partner before and takes little pleasure in intimacy.
