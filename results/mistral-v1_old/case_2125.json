She also complains of bone pain, specifically in her right forearm and right thigh, and a persistent dry cough. She states she has been very tired lately, which is why it took her so long to see a doctor when she returned from her trip. Since returning, she has been living in Arizona for the past 2 weeks with her brother who owns 2 parrots and a dog.

Her complete blood count reveals pancytopenia. A peripheral blood smear shows evidence of lymphoblasts. A computed tomography of the chest reveals multiple, centrilobular nodules in the left upper lobe. A radiograph of the right thigh and right upper extremity shows osteolytic bone lesions.
