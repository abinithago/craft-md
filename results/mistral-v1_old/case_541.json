{"case_id": "case_541", "case_vignette": "A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after coughing up copious amounts of blood-tinged sputum at his nursing home. He recently had an upper respiratory tract infection that was treated with antibiotics. He has a long-standing history of productive cough that has worsened since he had a stroke 3 years ago. He smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years until the stroke, after which he quit. The patient appears distressed and short of breath. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 145/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Physical examination shows digital clubbing and cyanosis of the lips. Coarse crackles are heard in the thorax. An x-ray of the chest shows increased translucency and tram-track opacities in the right lower lung field.
