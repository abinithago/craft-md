Physical examination shows symmetrically distributed papules 4\u20138 mm in diameter, excoriation marks, and patchy hyperpigmentation over his shoulders, waist, and buttocks. There is nontender inguinal lymphadenopathy and several firm, nontender subcutaneous nodules along the right iliac crest. Six skin snip biopsies are taken from the pelvic girdle, buttocks, and thigh, and are then incubated in saline. After 24 hours, microscopic examination shows motile microfilariae.
