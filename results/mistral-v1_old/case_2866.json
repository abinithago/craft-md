{"case_id": "case_2866", "case_vignette": "A 64-year-old man is admitted with a history of altered mental status. He was in his usual state of health until a few days ago when he has started to become confused, lethargic, forgetful, and repeating the same questions. Over the last few days, he sometimes appears perfectly normal, and, at other times, he has difficulty recognizing his family members. Yesterday, he was screaming that the room was filled with snakes. Past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, managed medically, and chronic kidney disease, for which he undergoes regular hemodialysis on alternate days. There is no history of smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. His vitals include: blood pressure 129/88 mm Hg, pulse 112/min, temperature 38.2\u00b0C (100.8\u00b0F), and respiratory rate 20/min. The patient is oriented only to person and place. His mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score is 18/30, where he had difficulty performing basic arithmetic calculations and recalled only 1 out of 3 objects. Nuchal rigidity is absent. Muscle strength is 5/5 bilaterally.
