Furthermore, he has had frequent episodes of constipation since birth. Except for frequent cravings for salty foods, the boy eats a regular diet. The patient was delivered healthy and is fully immunized. The medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has no siblings. His father is a banker and his mother is a librarian. The pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. He is in the bottom 10th percentile for height and weight according to his age. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable.
