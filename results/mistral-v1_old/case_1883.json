{"case_id": "case_1883", "case_vignette": "A 43-year-old woman presents to a new primary care physician complaining of anxiety. She has been worrying non-stop recently about the possibility that her husband will lose his job as a teacher. Her husband, who is present, assures the physician that his job is entirely secure and states that she has \"fretted\" for their entire marriage, though the exact topic causing her anxiety varies over time. She also worries excessively about everyday tasks, such as whether she will catch the train on time and whether their house in Southern California is sufficiently earthquake-proof. She has no way to overcome these worries. She endorses other symptoms including poor sleep (associated with racing thoughts about her various worries), fatigue, and impaired concentration at work, all of which have been present for at least the past year. Her vital signs are within normal limits and there are no abnormalities on physical exam.
