His temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and warm right knee; range of motion is limited by pain. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. His hematocrit is 44%, leukocyte count is 10,300/mm3, and platelet count is 145,000/mm3. Serum electrolyte concentrations are within normal limits. Arthrocentesis is performed and the synovial fluid is cloudy. Gram stain is negative. Analysis of the synovial fluid shows a leukocyte count of 70,000/mm3 and 80% neutrophils.
