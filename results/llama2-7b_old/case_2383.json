This is a common condition where the discs in your spine break down over time, leading to pain and stiffness in the back.\n\nWe can treat this condition with a combination of physical therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. Physical therapy can help to strengthen the muscles in your back and improve your posture, which can help to reduce the pain. Medication can help to manage the pain and inflammation, and lifestyle changes such as regular exercise and good posture can also help to reduce the symptoms.\n\nIn some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat degenerative disc disease.
