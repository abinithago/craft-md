In that case, I would like to recommend that you schedule an appointment with a hematologist, a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of blood disorders.\n\nThe hematologist will perform a thorough physical examination and review your medical history to identify the underlying cause of your symptoms. They may also order additional tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) or a bone marrow biopsy, to help confirm the diagnosis.\n\nBased on the results of these tests, the hematologist may recommend a course of treatment to help manage your symptoms and address any underlying conditions. This could include medications to control bleeding or reduce the risk of infection, or in some cases, more invasive procedures such as a blood transfusion or bone marrow transplant.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns."}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents to the clinic with several concerns.
