Aim to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water per day.\n2. Modify your diet: A diet high in animal protein, sodium, and sugar can increase the risk of kidney stones. Consider reducing your intake of these substances and focusing on a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n3. Lose weight: If you are overweight or obese, losing weight can help reduce your risk of high blood pressure and kidney stones.
