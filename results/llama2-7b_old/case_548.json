Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes caused by an excess of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is normally present in the bloodstream, but levels can become elevated in certain conditions.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis of jaundice, I will need to perform a series of tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), a liver function test (LFT), and a bilirubin level. These tests will help me determine the cause of the jaundice and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nIn addition to the tests I mentioned earlier, I will also need to perform a physical examination to check for any other signs of liver disease or other conditions that may be contributing to the jaundice.\n\nBased on the results of these tests, I will be able to provide you with a more definitive diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment options."}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents with increasing yellowing of the eyes and skin for 2 weeks.
