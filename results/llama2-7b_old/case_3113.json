One test is called the Tinel's sign, which involves tapping on the radial nerve in the arm to see if it causes any numbness or tingling sensations. Another test is called the Phalen's maneuver, which involves bending the elbow to see if it reproduces any symptoms.\n\nIf these tests are positive, it suggests that the radial nerve is being compressed or irritated, and further testing may be necessary to determine the cause.
