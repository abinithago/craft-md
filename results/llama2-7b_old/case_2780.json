Based on your history of recurring lung infections, it's possible that you may have a chronic respiratory condition, such as bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis. These conditions can cause repeated infections and inflammation in the airways, leading to symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing.\n\nI would recommend that you consult with a pulmonologist or a respiratory specialist to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They will perform a thorough examination and may order diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray, CT scan, or mucus analysis to determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can do to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, tea, and soup.\n2. Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air, which can help to loosen and clear mucus from your airways.\n3.
