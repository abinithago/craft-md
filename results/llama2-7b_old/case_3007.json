Blood tests: These will help us check for infection, inflammation, or other conditions that may be causing your pain.\n2. Urine tests: These will help us check for infection or other conditions that may be affecting your urinary system.\n3. Imaging tests: We may order an abdominal CT scan or an MRI to help us visualize your abdominal organs and look for any signs of inflammation or other conditions that may be causing your pain.\n4. Endoscopy: This is a procedure where a flexible tube with a camera and light on the end is inserted through your mouth and into your stomach to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. This can help us identify any inflammation or other conditions that may be causing your pain.\n\nOnce we have the results of these tests, we can work together to develop a treatment plan to help manage your symptoms.\n\n"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient has been experiencing pain in the upper area of their abdomen.
