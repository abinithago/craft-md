Based on the information provided, I would like to suggest a few possible causes for the rash that you've been experiencing.\n\nOne possibility is that the rash could be caused by a skin condition called keratosis pilaris (KP). KP is a common condition that causes small, rough bumps on the skin, often on the arms, legs, buttocks, and cheeks. It can be caused by genetics, dry skin, or allergies.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rash could be caused by eczema, which is a chronic skin condition that can cause dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. Eczema can be triggered by a variety of factors, including allergies, stress, and environmental irritants.\n\nIt's also possible that the rash could be caused by a fungal or bacterial infection, such as ringworm or impetigo. These infections can cause redness, itching, and bumps on the skin.\n\nI recommend that you schedule an appointment with a dermatologist to have your rash evaluated and to"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient has been experiencing a rash that comes and goes on their arms and face for about a year.

Every few months, the patient gets several new red bumps, but they haven't noticed them getting worse with any specific products or activities. The rash isn't itchy or painful at all. The patient's skin hasn't been dry, tight, or sensitive, and they haven't tried any new skincare products or cosmetics recently. There haven't been any previous skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or acne, and no recent illnesses or infections either.

The rash appeared gradually and the red bumps fade over several weeks, but there have been new bumps every few months.
