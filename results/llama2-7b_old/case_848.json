Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have a condition called retrobulbar optic neuropathy. This is a relatively rare condition that affects the optic nerve and can cause pain with eye movement, difficulty distinguishing colors, and pain in the eye.\n\nRetrobulbar optic neuropathy can be caused by a variety of factors, including inflammation, infection, or compression of the optic nerve. It can also be caused by certain medications, such as chemotherapy drugs, or by underlying medical conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or thyroid disorders.\n\nIt's important to schedule an appointment with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. The doctor may perform a comprehensive eye exam to evaluate your vision, eye alignment, and optic nerve function. They may also order additional tests, such as imaging studies or blood tests, to help identify the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some self-care measures to help manage your symptoms"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient had been experiencing vision issues in their right eye for the past 2 weeks.
