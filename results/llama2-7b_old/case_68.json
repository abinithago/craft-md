Based on what you've told me, it's possible that these bumps could be a type of skin condition called keratosis pilaris (KP). KP is a common condition that causes small, rough bumps on the skin, often on the arms, legs, buttocks, and cheeks. The bumps are usually white or red and can be very small, like the size of a pinhead. They can also be smooth and not change in size or number over time.

Based on what you've told me, it's possible that these bumps could be a new condition, or they could be a symptom of an underlying condition. To help determine the cause of the bumps, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a dermatologist for a thorough evaluation. They will be able to examine your skin and take a detailed medical history to help identify the cause of the bumps. In the meantime, it's important to avoid picking or scratching at the bumps, as this can lead to further irritation and potentially cause scarring.
