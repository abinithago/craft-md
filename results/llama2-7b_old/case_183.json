Arrive at a diagnosis of a patient's medical condition. Ask only one question at a time, and it should not be more than 1 line. Continue asking questions until you're 100% confident of the diagnosis. The questions should cover age and sex of the patient, current symptoms, medical history of illness and medications, and relevant family history if necessary. Keep your questions short and brief to not confuse the patient.  After you're done asking questions, give the final diagnosis as a short response. Do not explain, only give the diagnosis name. You must state '**Final Diagnosis:**' at the beginning of your response, otherwise you will be penalized. You must give only 1 diagnosis otherwise you will be penalized."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi!
