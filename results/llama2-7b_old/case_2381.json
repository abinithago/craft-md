His past medical history is unremarkable. The patient admits that he has always lived in poor hygienic conditions in overcrowded quarters and in close contact with cats. His vital signs include: blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg, pulse 90/min, and temperature 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals generalized pallor. A cardiac examination reveals an early diastolic murmur loudest at the left third intercostal space. Abdominal examination reveals a tender and mildly enlarged spleen. Prominent axillary lymphadenopathy is noted. Laboratory investigations reveal a WBC count of 14,500/\u03bcL with 5% bands and 93% polymorphonuclear cells. An echocardiogram reveals a 5-mm vegetation on the aortic valve with moderate regurgitation. Three sets of blood cultures are taken over 24 hours followed by empiric antibiotic therapy with gentamicin and vancomycin. The blood cultures show no growth after 5 days. Following a week of empiric therapy, the patient continues to deteriorate.
