High blood sugar levels can damage the nerves and blood vessels in the feet, leading to numbness, tingling, and ulcers.\n\nI would like to refer you to a specialist, such as a podiatrist or a endocrinologist, for further evaluation and treatment. They can help you manage your diabetes and prevent any further complications.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend that you start taking your insulin as prescribed and make any necessary lifestyle changes to manage your blood sugar levels. This may include a healthy diet, regular exercise, and monitoring your blood sugar levels regularly.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and I will do my best to address them."}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents to the clinic with a month-long history of fevers over 101 degrees and pain in the left lower leg and foot, especially when weight is put on it.
