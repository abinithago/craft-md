His hospital course is prolonged by pneumonia, which is managed with vancomycin, pipercillin-tazobactam, and gentamicin to cover for ventilator-associated etiologies. He is maintained on nasogastric tube feeds, lactated ringer fluid boluses, and subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
