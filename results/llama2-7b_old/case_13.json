Based on what you've told me, I would suspect that you may have a condition called acne vulgaris. Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition that causes inflamed red bumps and pimples, often on the face, neck, chest, and back. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal changes, excess oil production, and clogged pores.\n\nI would recommend starting with a topical retinoid cream or gel, such as adapalene or tretinoin, to help reduce inflammation and prevent new breakouts. These medications can take several weeks to start working, so it's important to be patient and consistent with treatment.\n\nIn addition to topical treatments, oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or minocycline may also be prescribed to help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that can contribute to acne.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that acne can be a chronic condition, and it may take time and trial and error to find the right combination of treat"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents to the clinic with red bumps and big pimples on their face, neck, chest, and back that come and go with their menstrual cycle.
