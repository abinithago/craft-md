The parent also notes that there have been no changes in the baby's routine or symptoms like gas, bloating, or discomfort during feedings. The baby has been exclusively breastfed and there are no issues with reflux, spitting up, or trouble burping. Despite these difficulties with feeding, there have been no changes in the baby's poop pattern.
