Based on what you've told me, I would like to consider the possibility of a hormonal imbalance as the cause of your heavy and irregular periods.\n\nHormonal imbalances can occur for a variety of reasons, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, and other endocrine imbalances. These conditions can cause changes in the levels of hormones such as estrogen and progesterone, which can lead to heavy and irregular periods.\n\nI would recommend that you consult with a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms. They may recommend further testing or evaluation to determine the cause of your heavy and irregular periods.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or naproxen can help to reduce cramps and heavy bleeding.\n2. Wearing a menstrual cup or using a heavy flow pad can help to reduce the amount of bleeding.\n3"}], "summarized_conversation": "A 28-year-old female presents to the clinic with concerns about heavy and irregular periods.
