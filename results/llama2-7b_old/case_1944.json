Based on what you've told me, it's possible that you may have a benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) episode. BPPV is a common condition that occurs when small crystals in the inner ear become dislodged and move into the canals of the inner ear, causing a person to feel dizzy or vertigo when they change positions.\n\nThe maneuvers I asked you to perform earlier, such as quickly turning your head to the left and lying back quickly, can sometimes trigger BPPV episodes. The unusual eye movements you noticed after these maneuvers are also consistent with BPPV.\n\nI recommend that you consult with a healthcare professional, such as an otolaryngologist (ENT specialist), for further evaluation and treatment. They can perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1.
