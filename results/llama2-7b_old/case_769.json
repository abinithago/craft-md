Fundoscopic examination of the right eye shows a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula. The optic disc appears normal.

Based on what you've told me, I would like to consider a few possible causes for your sudden vision loss:\n\n1. Central retinal vein occlusion: This is a blockage of the central retinal vein, which can cause sudden vision loss in one eye. It is more common in people over the age of 50 and is often associated with other medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol.\n2. Branch retinal vein occlusion: This is a similar condition to central retinal vein occlusion, but it affects the smaller branches of the retinal vein.\n3. Retinal detachment: This occurs when the retina becomes separated from the underlying tissue, causing vision loss. It can be caused by injury, disease, or age-related changes.\n4.
