Based on what you've told me, I would like to consider the possibility of a migraine. Migraines are a type of headache that can cause severe, debilitating pain, often on one side of the head, along with other symptoms such as sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and vomiting. They can be triggered by a variety of factors, including hormonal changes, stress, certain foods, and environmental factors.\n\nGiven your history of similar symptoms last summer and the fact that you haven't noticed any specific patterns or triggers, it's possible that you may be experiencing migraines. The fact that you've been taking indomethacin every 6 hours without relief also supports this possibility.\n\nI would recommend that you consult with a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment.
