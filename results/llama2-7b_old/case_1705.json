Based on your symptoms, it's possible that your hand stiffness could be related to a number of factors, including:\n\n1. Age-related changes: As we age, our joints can become less flexible and more prone to stiffness, especially in the morning.\n2. Overuse or repetitive motion: If you perform repetitive tasks with your hands, such as typing or playing a musical instrument, it could lead to stiffness and soreness in your hands.\n3. Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or tendonitis, can cause hand stiffness and pain.\n4. Sleep position: The way you sleep can affect the flexibility of your hands. Sleeping with your hands in an awkward position or with your wrists bent can lead to stiffness in the morning.\n5. Medications: Certain medications, such as corticosteroids, can cause hand stiffness as a side effect.\n\nTo help determine the cause of your hand stiffness, I would like to ask you some additional questions:"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents to the clinic complaining of pain and stiffness in their hands upon waking up in the morning for the past several months.
