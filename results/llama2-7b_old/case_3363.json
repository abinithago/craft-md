In addition, there are some medications that can help reduce the inflammation and damage to the red blood cells, which can help improve your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can do to help manage your fatigue. Getting enough rest and taking breaks throughout the day can help. You can also try to avoid activities that make you feel tired or short of breath, and try to do things that you enjoy and that make you feel good.\n\nDoes that make sense?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, it makes sense.
