Based on what you've told me, it's possible that you may have developed a condition called \"shin splints,\" which is a common overuse injury in runners. Shin splints occur when the muscles, tendons, and bone tissue in the shin area become inflamed or irritated due to repetitive stress or overuse.\n\nShin splints can cause pain in the front and side of the shin, and may be worse when running or walking. Treatment for shin splints usually involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) of the affected area, as well as physical therapy exercises to help stretch and strengthen the muscles and tendons in the shin.
