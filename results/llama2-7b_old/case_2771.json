However, in some cases, the fungus can overgrow and cause the symptoms you're experiencing.\n\nI would recommend using an antifungal medication to treat the infection. It's available in the form of a liquid or a lozenge, and you can use it as directed to help clear up the infection.\n\nIn addition to using the medication, there are some things you can do at home to help relieve your symptoms. For example, you can try using a saltwater rinse to help reduce the inflammation and kill off the fungus. You can also try using a humidifier to add moisture to the air, which can help to soothe the throat and reduce the risk of fungal infections.\n\n"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents to the clinic with difficulty swallowing for the past 4 days.
