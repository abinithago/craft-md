This can be due to too many visitors, loud noises, or too much stimulation from toys and games.\n2. Sleep reflux: Some babies may experience sleep reflux, which can cause them to sleep more than usual and have difficulty feeding.\n3. Gas or digestive issues: Gas and digestive issues can make a baby uncomfortable and cause them to sleep more than usual.\n4. Temperature regulation: Some babies may have difficulty regulating their body temperature, leading to overheating or overcooling, which can cause excessive sleepiness.\n5.
