Based on what you've told me, I would like to consider a few possible causes for the blue spots on your skin.\n\nOne possibility is that the spots are a form of birthmark, which are common in newborns and can appear as blue or purple spots. These usually resolve on their own within the first few months of life, but can sometimes persist.\n\nAnother possibility is that the spots are caused by a condition called hemangioma, which is a benign growth of blood vessels. This can cause blue or red spots to appear on the skin, and can occur in newborns as well as older children and adults.\n\nFinally, it's possible that the spots are a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as a genetic disorder or an infection. However, this is less likely given your baby's otherwise normal appearance and behavior.\n\nI would recommend consulting with a pediatrician or a dermatologist to have the spots evaluated and to rule out any potential underlying conditions.
