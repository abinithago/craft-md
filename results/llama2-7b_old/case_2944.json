Based on your symptoms and medical history, I would like to recommend a few possible causes for your swollen legs.\n\n1.

It can be caused by genetic predisposition, injury, infection, or surgery.\n2. Venous insufficiency: This is a condition where the veins in the legs have difficulty returning blood to the heart, leading to swelling and fluid buildup. It can be caused by factors such as age, obesity, or injury.\n3. Heart failure: In some cases, swollen legs can be a symptom of heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively.\n\nI would like to refer you to a specialist for further evaluation and diagnosis.
