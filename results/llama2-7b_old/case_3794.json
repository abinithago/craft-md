Based on your symptoms and medical history, I would like to perform a few tests to help determine the cause of your abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. I will need to perform a thorough physical examination and order some diagnostic tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and a stool culture. These tests will help us rule out any underlying infections or other conditions that may be causing your symptoms.\n\nCan you please let me know when you are available to come in for the tests?
