Based on what you've told me, I would like to suggest a few possibilities for your dry mouth and tooth decay.\n\nOne possibility is that you may have a condition called xerostomia, which is characterized by a decrease in saliva production. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including certain medications, medical conditions such as Sjogren's syndrome, and even some types of cancer treatment.\n\nAnother possibility is that you may have a fungal infection in your mouth, such as thrush. This can cause white patches to appear on your tongue or inner cheeks, and can also lead to a dry mouth.\n\nFinally, it's possible that you may have a bacterial infection in your mouth, such as gum disease or an abscess. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including a dry mouth, tooth sensitivity, and gum inflammation.\n\nI would recommend that you make an appointment with your dentist to have your mouth examined and to rule out any of these possibilities.
