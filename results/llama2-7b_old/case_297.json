Based on your symptoms, it seems possible that you may have a neurological disorder that is affecting your nervous system.\n\nThe weakness in your right leg and decreased sensation to touch in your arms could be indicative of a peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. The exaggerated reflexes in your legs and urinary incontinence could also be related to a neurological disorder.\n\nIt's important to see a doctor for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They may recommend some tests such as a neurological exam, electromyography (EMG), and nerve conduction studies to determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some potential causes of your symptoms:\n\n1.
