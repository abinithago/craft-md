This is a common condition that occurs when the muscles and ligaments in the lower back are stretched or torn, usually as a result of heavy lifting or bending.\n\nI would recommend that you take the following steps to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Rest: Avoid heavy lifting, bending, or twisting for the next few days to give your back time to heal.\n2. Ice: Apply ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, to help reduce pain and inflammation.\n3. Stretching: Gentle stretching exercises can help reduce muscle tension and improve flexibility. Focus on stretching your hamstrings, hip flexors, and lower back muscles.\n4. Over-the-counter pain medication: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce pain and inflamm"}], "summarized_conversation": "A 45-year-old individual has been experiencing persistent back pain that worsened after assisting their son in moving heavy furniture over the weekend.
