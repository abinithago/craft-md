Use a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer: Look for a moisturizer that is formulated for dry skin and contains ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, or niacinamide, which can help lock in moisture and support the skin's natural barrier function.\n2. Exfoliate regularly: Gently exfoliating your skin with a gentle scrub or brush can help remove dead skin cells and improve skin texture.
