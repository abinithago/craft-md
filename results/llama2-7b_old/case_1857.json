Based on what you've told me, it's possible that one of the women you had unprotected sex with may be experiencing symptoms of an STI, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. These infections can cause abdominal pain, among other symptoms.\n\nIt's important that you inform any sexual partners that you have been in contact with about your symptoms, so that they can also be tested and treated if necessary. You may also want to consider getting tested for STIs yourself, as it's possible that you may have contracted an infection.\n\nIn addition to STIs, there are other possible causes of abdominal pain in men, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or a urinary tract infection. It's important to see a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or concerns."}], "summarized_conversation": "A young man presents to the clinic with sudden abdominal pain that started while he was playing football about two hours ago.
