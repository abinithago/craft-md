Based on your symptoms and the fact that the rash only appears during the summer months, it's possible that it could be caused by a condition called heat rash. Heat rash, also known as prickly heat or miliaria, is a common condition that occurs when the skin's sweat glands become blocked and swell, causing redness, itching, and small bumps on the skin.\n\nDo you live in a hot and humid climate during the summer months?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, it does get quite hot and humid here in the summer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great, that helps to confirm the diagnosis. Heat rash is more common in hot and humid climates, and it can be triggered by excessive sweating and poor air circulation.\n\nTo help manage the heat rash, you can try using a cooling cream or gel on the affected area, and avoiding activities that cause excessive sweating. You can also try to keep the area dry and clean, and wear loose, breathable clothing to help keep the skin cool and comfortable.\n\nIn addition to these measures, you may also want to consider taking steps to prevent heat rash from occurring in the first place. This can include staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water, avoiding strenuous activities during the hottest part of the day, and taking breaks in shady or air-conditioned areas when needed.\n\nI hope this helps!
