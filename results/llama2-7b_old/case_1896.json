Based on what you've told me, I would like to suggest a few possible causes for the crunching and rasping sound you're hearing when listening to your heart:\n\n1. Heart Valve Problems: The crunching and rasping sound you're hearing could be due to problems with the heart valves. The valves in the heart help to regulate blood flow and prevent blood from flowing backward. If the valves are damaged or diseased, they may not function properly, leading to the abnormal sound you're hearing.\n2. Heart Murmur: A heart murmur is an abnormal sound heard during a heartbeat that is caused by abnormal blood flow through the heart valves or through a hole in the heart. The crunching and rasping sound you're hearing could be a sign of a heart murmur.\n3. Pericarditis: Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac that surrounds the heart. This can cause a crunching or rasping sound when the heart beats.\n4.
