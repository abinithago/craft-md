Based on what you've told me, it's possible that the tan patches could be a benign condition called nevus of Ota. Nevus of Ota is a rare congenital condition that causes tan or brown patches on the skin, typically on the face or neck.

Based on the information you've provided, I will make a diagnosis of Nevus of Ota.\n\nNevus of Ota is a benign skin condition that is characterized by tan or brown patches on the skin, typically on the face or neck. It is caused by an abnormal growth of pigment-producing cells in the skin, called melanocytes. The patches are usually symmetrical and can vary in size and shape. They may also be associated with other symptoms such as itching or discomfort.\n\nI recommend that you consult with a dermatologist or other healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment. They can confirm the diagnosis and provide guidance on the best course of treatment for you.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\n\nFinal diagnosis: Nevus of Ota."}], "summarized_conversation": "A 16-year-old girl presents to the clinic with concerns about six tan spots on her upper body and arms, as well as freckles under her armpits.
