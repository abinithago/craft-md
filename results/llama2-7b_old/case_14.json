The exact cause of palmoplantar keratoderma is not known, but it can be associated with certain medical conditions, such as psoriasis, eczema, and diabetes.\n\nOther possible causes of the symptoms you're experiencing could include a condition called keratosis palmaris, which is a benign thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands, or a fungal infection of the skin, such as athlete's foot.\n\nIn order to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms, I would recommend consulting with a dermat"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient has had skin blisters since birth, mainly on their hands, feet, and around their mouth, with some appearing in a ring shape on the body.
