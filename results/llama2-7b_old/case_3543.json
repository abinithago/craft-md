She has remained an active member of her retirement community's wine club; however, she stopped attending the meetings 3 weeks ago. She is generally able to her maintain her house, but her house appears more disorganized over the past 2 weeks. She generally drives short distances but avoids driving long distances as she occasionally gets lost when navigating new areas. She feels like her balance is getting worse, but she has not fallen. She has noticed increased urinary urgency over the past 8 months and has had 2 episodes of incontinence. Despite these changes, she reports feeling well. She drinks 4-6 glasses of wine per day. She was started on multiple medications for worsening anxiety by her psychiatrist 1 month ago. Her BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 99.8\u00b0F (37.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/65 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 17/min. On examination, she is oriented to person and time but not place or situation. She does not seem to recognize her doctor despite knowing him for many years. She becomes somnolent intermittently throughout the interview. She can recall 0/3 words after 5 minutes. She has a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement.
