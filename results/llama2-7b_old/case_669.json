Treatment options for papillary thyroid cancer depend on the size and location of the tumor, as well as your overall health. Here are some of the most common treatment options:\n\n1. Surgery: Surgery is often the first line of treatment for papillary thyroid cancer. The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor and any affected lymph nodes. The most common surgical procedure for papillary thyroid cancer is a thyroidectomy, which involves removing part or all of the thyroid gland.\n2. Radioactive iodine therapy: After surgery, radioactive iodine therapy may be recommended to kill any remaining cancer cells in the thyroid gland. This treatment is usually given in a single dose, and it can take several months for the radiation to work.\n3. Thyroid hormone therapy: If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, thyroid hormone therapy may be recommended to reduce the levels of thyroid hormones in the body. This can help slow the growth of the cancer.\n4.

Based on the information you've provided, I would like to recommend that you undergo a thyroid ultrasound and fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy to further evaluate the lump in your neck.\n\nThe ultrasound will help us to better visualize the lump and determine its size, shape, and location. The FNA biopsy will allow us to obtain a tissue sample from the lump, which will be examined under a microscope to determine if it is benign or malignant.\n\nIf the biopsy results are inconclusive or show signs of cancer, we may recommend additional tests such as a thyroid scan, CT scan, or MRI to further evaluate the extent of the cancer.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and we can discuss further details about the procedure and what to expect."}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient has noticed a painless lump on their neck that has been growing for the past 3 months.
