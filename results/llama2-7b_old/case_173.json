KP is a common skin condition characterized by the appearance of small, rough bumps on the skin, often on the arms, legs, buttocks, and cheeks. It is caused by the buildup of keratin, a protein that protects the skin, and can be inherited or caused by dry skin, allergies, or other factors.\n\nKP can be treated with topical creams or lotions that contain ingredients such as urea, salicylic acid, or glycolic acid.
