Initially, he thought she was joking, but soon realized her complaints of \u2018hearing ghosts\u2019 talking to her throughout the house were persisting and \u2018getting worse\u2019. There was also a 4-week period where she experienced insomnia and an unintentional weight loss of 12 pounds. She seemed sad throughout these episodes, and, according to her husband, was complaining of feeling \u2018worthless\u2019. Her general hygiene has also suffered from her recent lack of motivation and she insists that the \u2018ghosts\u2019 are asking her to kill as many people as she can so they won\u2019t be alone in the house.

She does not smoke or drink alcohol. The patient herself does not make eye contact or want to speak to the psychiatrist, allowing her husband to speak on her behalf.
