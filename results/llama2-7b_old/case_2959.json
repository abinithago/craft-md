Based on your symptoms and physical examination findings, I believe you may have a testicular torsion. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention.\n\nTesticular torsion occurs when the spermatic cord becomes twisted, cutting off blood flow to the testicle. If left untreated, it can lead to permanent damage or even loss of the testicle.\n\nI recommend that you go to the emergency room or urgent care right away for further evaluation and treatment. They will likely perform an ultrasound and/or CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to keep the affected testicle at a lower temperature to reduce the risk of further damage. You can do this by applying a cold compress or ice pack to the area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day.\n\nPlease seek medical attention immediately and inform the healthcare provider of your symptoms and any other relevant information."}], "summarized_conversation": "An 11-year-old boy presents to the clinic with sudden and severe pain in his left scrotum, accompanied by vomiting.
