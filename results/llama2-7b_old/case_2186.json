Based on your symptoms and the information you've provided, it's possible that your tinnitus is caused by earwax buildup.

They can use specialized tools to examine your ears and determine the cause of your tinnitus. They may also be able to remove any excess earwax that is contributing to the problem.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage your tinnitus. Avoid loud noises, take breaks when listening to music or watching TV, and try to relax when you're feeling anxious or stressed. Some people also find it helpful to use white noise machines or sound therapy to mask the ringing in their ears.\n\nDoes that make sense?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, I understand and I'll follow your advice to see a doctor for a check-up on my ears.
