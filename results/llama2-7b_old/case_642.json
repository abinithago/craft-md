It can also cause a decrease in the ability to hear faint sounds or sounds at a distance.\n\nThere are several treatment options available for presbycusis, including hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other assistive devices. I recommend scheduling an appointment with an audiologist or hearing specialist for a comprehensive evaluation and to discuss your treatment options.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can do to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Avoid loud noises and take steps to protect your hearing, such as wearing earplugs or earmuffs when necessary.\n2. Use a phone with a volume limit or a loudness boost feature to help you hear more clearly.\n3. Ask friends and family to face you when speaking and to speak more slowly and clearly.\n4"}], "summarized_conversation": "A 78-year-old individual is reporting a progressive hearing loss in both ears over the past year.

In that case, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with an audiologist or a hearing specialist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation. They can perform a series of tests to assess your hearing and determine the best course of treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can do to help manage your hearing loss. For example, you can try using a hearing aid directory to find a hearing aid that suits your needs and budget. You can also try using a sound amplifier or a hearing enhancement device to help improve your hearing in noisy environments.\n\nRemember, it's important to address hearing loss as soon as possible to prevent further damage and improve your overall quality of life."}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents to the clinic with progressive hearing loss in both ears over the past year and finds it hard to understand conversations in crowded places or when multiple people are speaking at once.
