This is a common condition that occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles become inflamed or irritated due to repetitive movements or injuries.\n\nThe symptoms you described, such as sharp pain worsening with movement and stiffness in the morning, are consistent with this condition. The lack of weakness or numbness also suggests that the damage is likely to be occurring in the tendons or ligaments surrounding the shoulder joint, rather than in the joint itself.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, I would recommend an imaging study such as an MRI or ultrasound. These tests can help us visualize the soft tissues of the shoulder and confirm the presence of any tears or inflammation in the rotator cuff tendons.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend avoiding activities that exacerbate the pain and taking over-the-counter pain medications as needed to help manage your symptoms. If the diagnosis is confirmed, we can discuss further treatment options such"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient has been experiencing persistent pain in their right shoulder for the past two months, which worsens with movement. The pain is located at the top of the shoulder and there are no symptoms of numbness or tingling in the arm or hand.
