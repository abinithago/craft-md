Based on what you've told me, I would like to suggest a few possible causes for your rash and fever:\n\n1. Bacterial infection: It's possible that you have contracted a bacterial infection from the freshwater streams, such as Legionella or Pseudomonas. These bacteria can cause a rash and fever, especially after swimming in contaminated water.\n2. Viral infection: Another possibility is that you have contracted a viral infection, such as swimmer's itch or a cold, from the streams. These viruses can cause a rash and fever, as well as other symptoms like itching and fatigue.\n3. Allergic reaction: It's also possible that you are experiencing an allergic reaction to something in the freshwater streams, such as algae or other microorganisms.
