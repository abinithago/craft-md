Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, for which she takes metformin. She lives with her husband and takes oral contraceptive pills. On examination, the physician observes hyperpigmentation of the medial aspect of her right ankle. The skin is dry, scaly, and edematous along with some superficial varicosities. Dorsiflexion of the foot is extremely painful. Peripheral pulses are equally palpable on both lower limbs. There is a small 2 cm ulcer noted near the medial malleolus with thickened neighboring skin and indurated edges. Laboratory studies show D-dimer of 1,000 \u00b5g/L and HbA1c of 9%.
