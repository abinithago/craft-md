Based on what you've told me, it's possible that your shoulder discomfort could be related to overuse or repetitive strain from practicing rifle drills and firing exercises.\n\nI would recommend taking some time to rest and recover your shoulder, and avoiding any activities that may exacerbate the discomfort. You can also try some gentle stretching and strengthening exercises to help relieve the stiffness and pain.\n\nIn addition, you may want to consider consulting with a sports medicine professional or a physical therapist who can provide you with more specific guidance and treatment options. They can help you identify the cause of your shoulder discomfort and develop a plan to address it.\n\nRemember, it's important to take care of your body and address any injuries or discomfort as soon as possible to prevent them from becoming more serious."}], "summarized_conversation": "A 21-year-old man presents with increasing pain and stiffness in his right shoulder for the past 4 months.
