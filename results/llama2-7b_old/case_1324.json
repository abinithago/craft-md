Based on what you've told me, I would like to suggest a few possible causes for your pain:\n\n1. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder: The pain you are experiencing in your left cheek could be related to a problem with your temporomandibular joint, which connects your jawbone to your skull. TMJ disorder can cause pain in the jaw, face, and head, and can be triggered by activities like chewing and brushing teeth.\n2. Sinusitis: The pain in your left cheek could also be related to a sinus infection or inflammation. Sinusitis can cause pain in the face, particularly in the cheekbone area, and can be triggered by changes in weather or exposure to allergens.\n3. Dental problems: It's possible that a dental problem, such as a tooth abscess or a cracked tooth, could be causing the pain in your left cheek.\n\nI would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a dentist or a specialist in temporomandibular disorders"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient presents to the clinic with a complaint of pain in the left cheek that occurs every few hours and lasts for about half a minute to a minute, and it worsens when chewing or brushing the teeth.
