Based on what you've told me, I would like to consider a few potential causes for the swelling on your right side of your scrotum:\n\n1. Epididymitis: This is an inflammation of the epididymis, a tube that stores sperm. It can be caused by a bacterial infection, usually from a urinary tract infection (UTI) that has spread to the epididymis.\n2. Testicular torsion: This is a medical emergency that occurs when the spermatic cord becomes twisted, cutting off blood flow to the testicle. It can cause sudden and severe scrotal pain, swelling, and discoloration.\n3. Hydrocele: This is a fluid-filled sac that forms around the testicle, usually due to a blockage in the flow of fluid from the testicle. It can cause swelling and tenderness in the scrotum.\n4.
