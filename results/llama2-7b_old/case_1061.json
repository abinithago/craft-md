Anemia: As I mentioned earlier, anemia is a condition where the body does not have enough red blood cells or hemoglobin. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.\n2. Depression or anxiety: Mental health conditions can also cause fatigue and weakness. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety, it's important to seek professional help.\n3. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and weight gain.\n4.
