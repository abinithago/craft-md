Based on what you've told me, I would suspect that you may have a condition called functional dyspepsia. This is a common condition that can cause abdominal pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen, often accompanied by bloating, belching, and nausea.

Functional dyspepsia can be a challenging condition to manage, but there are several treatment options available that can help alleviate symptoms.\n\nHave you tried any over-the-counter antacids or acid reducers to see if they provide relief? These medications can help neutralize stomach acid and reduce inflammation in the digestive system. If you haven't already, I would recommend giving them a try to see if they help.\n\nIf your symptoms persist or worsen despite trying over-the-counter medications, it may be worth speaking with your primary care physician about prescription medication options. They may recommend a medication such as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or an H2 blocker, which can help reduce acid production in the stomach and alleviate symptoms.\n\nIn addition to medication, there are also several lifestyle changes you can make to help manage functional dyspepsia.

Some people find relief from conditions like functional dyspepsia through alternative therapies like acupuncture, herbal remedies, or probiotics.\n\nFinally, it's important to note that functional dyspepsia can sometimes be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or a food intolerance.
