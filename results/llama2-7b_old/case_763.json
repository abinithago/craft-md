Have you noticed any numbness or tingling sensations in your leg, especially in the area where you were hit by the baseball?\n3.

Based on what you've told me, I would like to consider a few possible causes for your leg pain:\n\n1. Soft tissue injury: The baseball hit could have caused a soft tissue injury to the muscles, tendons, or ligaments in your leg, leading to pain and swelling.\n2. Muscle strain: Overuse or overstretching of the muscles in your leg could also cause pain and swelling, especially if you've been engaging in physical activity without proper rest and recovery.\n3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The swelling in your leg could be a sign of a blood clot, which can occur when the blood flow in the leg is slowed down or blocked.\n\nI would recommend that you see a doctor for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They may perform imaging tests such as an X-ray or ultrasound to confirm the cause of your leg pain.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try applying ice to the affected area to reduce swelling, and taking over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient has been experiencing progressive pain in their left leg for 2 months, which has begun to disrupt their sleep.
