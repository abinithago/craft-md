Based on what you've told me, it's possible that your tantrums could be related to a few different things. Here are some potential causes:\n\n1. Emotional regulation difficulties: Children often struggle with managing their emotions, and this can lead to tantrums. It's possible that you're having trouble regulating your emotions and expressing them in a healthy way.\n2. Sensory processing issues: Some children have difficulty processing sensory information, which can lead to feelings of overwhelm and tantrums.\n3. Executive function challenges: Executive function skills, such as planning, organization, and self-regulation, are still developing in children. If you're having trouble with these skills, it could be contributing to your tantrums.\n4.
