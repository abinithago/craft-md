There is no leakage of amniotic fluid. Since arrival, she has had 5 contractions in 10 minutes, each lasting 70 to 90 seconds. Pelvic examination shows a closed cervix and a uterus consistent in size with a 38-week gestation. Ultrasound shows a single live intrauterine fetus in a breech presentation consistent with a gestational age of approximately 37 weeks. The amniotic fluid index is 26 and the fetal heart rate is 92/min. The placenta is not detached. She is scheduled for an emergency lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate. The infant is delivered and APGAR score is noted to be 8 at 1 minute. The doctor soon notices cyanosis of the lips and oral mucosa, which does not resolve when the infant cries. The infant is foaming at the mouth and drooling. He also has an intractable cough.
