There are several treatment options for chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), depending on the severity of your symptoms and other individual factors.

They are available in different sizes and pressures, and can be purchased over-the-counter or by prescription.\n2. Elevating the legs: Elevating the legs above the level of the heart can help reduce swelling and improve blood flow. This can be done by lying down with the legs higher than the heart, or by using a leg elevator.\n3. Exercise: Gentle exercise, such as walking or cycling, can help improve blood flow and reduce symptoms. Aerobic exercises that involve the legs, such as running or swimming, can also be beneficial.\n4.
