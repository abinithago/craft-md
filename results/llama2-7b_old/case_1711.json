Pressure is applied to his bilateral wrist lacerations. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is 7. A full trauma assessment is performed and reveals no other injuries. IV fluids are started as well as a rapid transfusion sequence. Norepinephrine is administered. Repeat vitals demonstrate that his blood pressure is 100/65 mmHg and pulse is 100/min.
