They may consider adjusting your medication regimen or referring you to a physical therapist or occupational therapist who can help you manage the dystonia.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help reduce muscle tension and promote relaxation.\n2. Use physical therapy: A physical therapist can work with you to develop exercises and stretches that can help improve muscle tone and reduce dystonia.\n3. Try botulinum toxin injections: Botulinum toxin injections have been shown to be effective in reducing dystonia in some people.\n"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient comes in with repetitive tongue twisting and abnormal movements in their hands and legs that started a few days ago.
