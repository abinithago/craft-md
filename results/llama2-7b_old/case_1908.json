Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Rest your eyes: If you're experiencing eye strain or fatigue, take a break and rest your eyes for a few minutes. Look away from the screen or object you're focusing on and focus on something else.\n2. Adjust the lighting: Make sure the lighting in the room is comfortable and not too bright or dim. Avoid placing a computer or other digital device in a position where you're looking directly at a light source.\n3.
