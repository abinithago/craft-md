The medication you are taking may be helping to relieve the pain by relaxing the blood vessels and improving blood flow to the heart.\n\nAnother possibility is that you may have a condition called costochondritis, which is inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone. This can cause chest pain that is often worsened by movement or deep breathing.\n\nIt is also possible that you may have a pulmonary embolism, which is a blockage in one of the arteries in the lungs.
