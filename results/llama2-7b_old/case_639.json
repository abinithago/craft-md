Patellofemoral pain syndrome: This is a common condition characterized by pain in the front of the knee, usually around the kneecap. It can be caused by overuse, poor alignment, or weak quadriceps muscles.\n2. Medial tibial stress syndrome: This is an overuse injury that occurs on the inside of the knee, usually caused by repetitive stress or overuse.\n3. Meniscal tears: The meniscus is a cartilage structure in the knee joint that can tear due to injury or wear and tear. This can cause knee pain, stiffness, and limited mobility.\n4. Osteoarthritis: This is a degenerative condition where the cartilage in the joint wears down over time, leading to bone-on-bone contact and pain.\n\nI would recommend an X-ray or MRI to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the condition.
