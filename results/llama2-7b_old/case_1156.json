In that case, based on the symptoms you've provided, I would suspect that you may have developed diabetes insipidus. Diabetes insipidus is a rare condition that causes the body to produce an excessive amount of urine, leading to frequent urination and thirst. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including a tumor or injury to the pituitary gland, which is the part of the brain that regulates hormone production.\n\nI would recommend that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or an endocrinologist for further evaluation and diagnosis. They may perform a series of tests, including blood tests and imaging studies, to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms and confirm the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and avoid dehydration, which can occur easily when the body is producing excessive amounts of urine. Your healthcare provider may also prescribe medication to help manage your symptoms.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.
