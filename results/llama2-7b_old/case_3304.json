Based on the information you've provided, I would like to consider a few potential causes of the rash on your wrist.\n\nOne possibility is an allergic reaction to a topical substance, such as a soap, detergent, or fragrance. This could be causing irritation and inflammation of the skin, leading to the redness and dryness you're experiencing.\n\nAnother possibility is contact dermatitis, which is a common skin reaction that occurs when the skin comes into contact with an allergen or irritant. This could be caused by something you've come into contact with recently, such as a new soap or detergent, or something you've been exposed to for a longer period of time, such as a chemical in your workplace.\n\nI would recommend avoiding any potential allergens or irritants and using a gentle, fragrance-free soap and moisturizer to help soothe the skin.
