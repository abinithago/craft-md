Based on what you've told me, it's possible that your urinary incontinence may be related to a few different factors, such as:\n\n1. Weakening of the pelvic floor muscles: As you mentioned, childbirth and aging can weaken the muscles and tissues that support the bladder and urethra, leading to urinary incontinence.\n2.
