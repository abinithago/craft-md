Based on what you've told me, it's possible that you may have a condition called overactive bladder (OAB). OAB is a common condition that can cause urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence.\n\nOther possible causes of urinary incontinence include:\n\n1. Stress incontinence: This occurs when the muscles that support the bladder and urethra are weakened, causing urine to leak when you cough, laugh, or exercise.\n2. Urge incontinence: This occurs when you have a strong, sudden need to urinate, and you may not always make it to the bathroom in time.\n3. Mixed incontinence: This is a combination of stress and urge incontinence.\n4.
