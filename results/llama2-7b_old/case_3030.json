I will also check for any abnormalities in your vagina and pelvic area.\n\nPlease undress from the waist down and lie back on the examination table. I will then perform the examination using a speculum to visualize your cervix and a gloved finger to check for any abnormalities in your vagina.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns during the examination.\n\nOnce the examination is complete, I will discuss the results with you and provide a diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nThank you for your cooperation."}], "summarized_conversation": "\nA patient presents with left-sided flank pain that spreads to the groin and pain during urination.
