Based on what you've told me, I believe it's possible that you may have a condition called hyperventilation syndrome.\n\nHyperventilation syndrome is a condition where a person experiences rapid and deep breathing, often accompanied by feelings of anxiety or panic. This can lead to changes in the body's chemistry, including a decrease in the level of carbon dioxide in the blood.\n\nI would like to refer you to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment. They will be able to perform additional tests and provide you with a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage your symptoms. Deep breathing exercises, relaxation techniques, and avoiding triggers such as stress or caffeine can be helpful.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and I will do my best to assist you."}], "summarized_conversation": "A 79-year-old man is not feeling any specific symptoms at the moment, but his neck veins appear swollen and his heart is beating very fast.
