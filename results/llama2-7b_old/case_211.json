They may perform blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels and determine the cause of your symptoms. Treatment for hypothyroidism typically involves taking synthetic thyroid hormones to replace the hormones that the thyroid gland is not producing.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some lifestyle changes to help manage your symptoms.
