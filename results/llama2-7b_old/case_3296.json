The patient says she can voluntarily control the jerking in some social situations, but when she is under stress, she feels the urge to jerk her neck and she feels better after that. The parents also report that during the past year, there have even been a few weeks when the frequency of the neck jerking had decreased drastically, only to increase again afterwards. On physical examination, she is a physically healthy female with normal vital signs. Her neurologic examination is normal. The pediatrician also notes that when he makes certain movements, the patient partially imitates these movements. The parents are very much concerned about her abnormal movements and insist on a complete diagnostic work-up.

Benign essential tremor (BET): As I mentioned earlier, BET is a common movement disorder that can cause involuntary tremors or shaking movements in various parts of the body, including the neck.\n2. Essential tremor (ET): This is a related condition to BET, but it typically affects the hands and arms more than the neck.\n3. Dystonia: This is a movement disorder that can cause involuntary muscle contractions and spasms, which can affect the neck and other parts of the body.\n4. Parkinson's disease: While rare, it's possible that your neck movements could be related to Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder that affects movement and balance.\n\nIt's important to note that these are just a few possibilities, and there could be other reasons for your neck movements as well. Your doctor has likely already considered these and other potential causes, and has ordered tests to help rule"}], "summarized_conversation": "A young individual has been experiencing repeated jerking movements of the neck for the past 2 years. The jerking occurs more frequently during times of stress or fatigue and can fluctuate in intensity over the course of several weeks. There is no associated pain, stiffness, or weakness, just the involuntary movements. The movements tend to occur more frequently during emotional moments or when feeling very fatigued, and the individual can temporarily suppress them in social situations. The individual has consulted with their pediatrician and undergone a thorough examination, including testing, but has not yet pursued any treatments.", "vignette_mcq": " The correct answer is: Increased activity in frontal subcortical regions in positron-emission tomography (PET) study.", "vignette_frq": " The presence of motor tics, such as neck jerking, and the improvement of symptoms following a compulsive behavior, such as imitation of movements, are most likely to confirm the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome.", "multiturn_mcq": " Final Diagnosis: Increased activity in frontal subcortical regions in positron-emission tomography (PET) study.", "multiturn_frq": " **Final Diagnosis:** Benign Essential Tremor (BET)", "singleturn_mcq": " Final Diagnosis: Dystonia.", "singleturn_frq": " Final Diagnosis: Benign Paroxysmal Vertigo of Childhood (BPVC)", "summarized_mcq": " The correct answer is: Increased activity in frontal subcortical regions in positron-emission tomography (PET) study.", "summarized_frq": " Based on the symptoms provided, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nTics.", "extracted_ans_vignette_frq": "tourette syndrome", "evaluation_vignette_frq": 1, "extracted_ans_multiturn_frq": "benign essential tremor", "evaluation_multiturn_frq": 0, "extracted_ans_singleturn_frq": "benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (bpvc)", "evaluation_singleturn_frq": 0, "extracted_ans_summarized_frq": "tics", "evaluation_summarized_frq": 0}}
