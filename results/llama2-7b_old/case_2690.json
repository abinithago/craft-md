Based on what you've told me, it's possible that you may be experiencing a mild form of dementia, such as transient global amnesia or temporary confusion. These conditions are usually caused by a temporary interruption in blood flow to the brain, which can lead to memory loss and confusion.\n\nI would like to ask you a few more questions to help determine the cause of your symptoms.

Your history of alcohol-related injuries and seizures from alcohol withdrawal can help explain your current symptoms of confusion and forgetfulness. Alcohol can have a significant impact on the brain, and repeated episodes of alcohol withdrawal can lead to long-term cognitive impairment.\n\nIt's possible that your recent symptoms are related to alcohol-induced brain damage or a condition called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is a type of brain damage caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. This condition can cause confusion, memory loss, and difficulty with coordination and muscle control.\n\nI would like to refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment. They will be able to perform a thorough examination and order imaging tests, such as a CT or MRI scan, to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to avoid alcohol altogether and to seek support for any addiction issues.
