Based on your symptoms and the test results, I believe you may have a condition called irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a common condition that affects the large intestine and can cause abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements.\n\nThere are several treatments available for IBS, including dietary changes, stress management techniques, and medications.

Based on your symptoms, it's possible that there could be another underlying cause for your symptoms. Here are a few other possibilities that we could consider:\n\n1. Functional dyspepsia: This is a condition where the stomach doesn't empty properly, leading to bloating and discomfort.\n2. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): This is a condition where stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus, causing discomfort and bloating.\n3. Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO): This is a condition where there is an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine, leading to bloating and discomfort.\n4. Food intolerances: Some people may experience symptoms after consuming certain foods, even if they are not allergic to them. Common culprits include gluten, dairy, and high-FODMAP foods.\n5.
