He has no history of serious illness. His father has a disc herniation.

Muscle strain: This can occur from overuse or repetitive motion, such as swimming or weightlifting.\n2. Herniated disk: This can occur when the gel-like center of a spinal disk bulges out through a tear in the outer layer, which can put pressure on nearby nerves and cause pain.\n3. Degenerative disc disease: This is a condition where the spinal disks break down over time, leading to pain and stiffness in the back.\n4.
