Based on what you've told me, I would like to ask some questions about your symptoms to help determine the possible cause of your numbness in your arms.\n\nCan you tell me more about the numbness you are experiencing?

Based on what you've told me, I would like to consider the possibility of a neurological disorder that affects the nerves in your arms.\n\nOne possible cause of numbness in both arms could be peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, alcoholism, and certain medications.\n\nAnother possible cause could be thoracic outlet syndrome, which is a condition where the nerves and blood vessels in the space between the neck and shoulder become compressed or irritated. This can cause numbness, tingling, and weakness in the arms and hands.\n\nI would like to refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation and diagnosis. They will be able to perform a thorough examination and order imaging studies or other tests as needed to determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend that you keep track of any changes in your symptoms and any medications you are taking"}], "summarized_conversation": "A patient has been experiencing numbness in both shoulders and arms for the past 8 weeks. The numbness has been getting worse since the patient fell at work and is present in both arms. The patient fell from scaffolding and landed on their back, with no reported head or neck injury. There have been no symptoms of dizziness, confusion, or difficulty with speaking or walking since the fall. The patient has a medical history of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease, with no past neck or back injuries. The patient is currently taking atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, labetalol, and metformin, with no reported changes in how the medications affect them; however, the numbness in the arms has been increasing. There is uncertainty about the family history of peripheral neuropathy, but some family members have diabetes.
