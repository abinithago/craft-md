It involves using a machine outside of your body to direct high-energy rays to the cancer cells in your breast.\n2. Internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy): This type of radiation therapy involves placing a small amount of radioactive material inside your breast, near the cancer cells. The radioactive material emits radiation for a short period of time, usually several hours or days, and then it is removed.\n3. Partial breast radiation therapy (PBRT): This type of radiation therapy involves directing the radiation to only part of the breast, rather than the entire breast. This can be a good option for women with early-stage breast cancer who have had a lumpectomy.\n\nThe duration of radiation therapy can vary depending on the type of radiation therapy you receive and the stage of your cancer.
