Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you have a condition called polymorphous light eruption (PLE). PLE is a common skin disorder that causes sensitivity to sunlight, resulting in redness, itching, or small blisters on the skin.\n\nPLE can be triggered by a variety of factors, including hormonal changes, stress, and certain medications. It can also be inherited, and some people may be more prone to developing PLE than others.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a dermatologist for a thorough evaluation. They may perform a physical examination of your skin and ask questions about your medical history and lifestyle to determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Avoid direct sunlight, especially during peak hours (10am-4pm) when the sun's rays are strongest.\n2.
