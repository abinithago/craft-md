Based on what you've shared, I would like to consider a few possible causes for your persistent cough and low-grade fever:\n\n1. Allergic bronchitis: Your history of seasonal allergies and the lack of other respiratory symptoms suggest that your cough could be related to postnasal drip or irritation of the respiratory tract by allergens.\n2. Acute bronchitis: A viral infection could be causing your cough and fever. Acute bronchitis is a common respiratory infection that can occur at any time of the year, but is more common during the winter months when people are more likely to be indoors and exposed to viruses.\n3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Your age and smoking history increase your risk for COPD. If you have been experiencing a persistent cough for more than a few weeks, it could be a sign of COPD.\n\nI would recommend that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician for further evaluation and diagnosis.
