{"case_id": "case_3071", "case_vignette": "A 55-year-old man presents to the physician with a cough which he has had for the last 5 years. He also mentions that he has been feeling breathless when playing any active sport for the last 1 year. He is a manager in a corporate company and has been a regular smoker for 10 years. He has visited multiple physicians and undergone multiple diagnostic evaluations, without permanent benefit. On physical examination his temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the heart rate is 88/min, the blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 20/min. Inspection suggests a barrel chest and auscultation reveals the presence of bilateral end-expiratory wheezing and scattered rhonchi. He undergoes a detailed diagnostic evaluation which includes a complete blood count, chest radiogram, arterial blood gas analysis, and pulmonary function tests, all of which confirm a diagnosis of chronic obstructive lung disease. After analyzing all the clinical information and diagnostic workup, the physician differentiates between emphysema and chronic bronchitis based on a single clue.
