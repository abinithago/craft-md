He has difficulties understanding conversations in crowded places and when more than one person talks at the same time. He has no dizziness, ear discharge, ringing noise, or ear pain. He has a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications include enalapril, metformin, and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Otoscopic examination shows pearly gray, translucent tympanic membranes with a normal light reflex. A vibrating 512 Hz tuning fork is placed on the left mastoid process. Once the patient no longer hears a tone, the fork is held over the ipsilateral ear and the patient reports to hear the tone again. The same test is repeated on the right side with similar results. There is no lateralization when a vibrating 512 Hz tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead.
