The appropriate medical therapy is initiated, and a subsequent biopsy of the temporal artery reveals arteritis. Five months later, the patient returns to her physician with a complaint of weakness, leading to difficulty climbing stairs, rising from a chair, and combing her hair. The patient states that this weakness has worsened gradually over the last 2 months. She reports that her headaches, jaw pain, and visual disturbances have resolved. Physical examination is significant for 4/5 strength for both hip flexion/extension as well as shoulder flexion/extension/abduction.
