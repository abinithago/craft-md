He is a shopkeeper by profession and sometimes behaves very rudely to the customers. Recently, he accused one of the customers of using black magic over his shop. He has been increasingly irritable, forgetting things, and having problems managing his finances over the past 8 months. He is also having difficulty finding words and recalling the names of objects during the conversation. There is no history of recent head trauma, fever, hallucinations, or abnormal limb movements. Past medical history is significant for a well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Family history is unremarkable. He does not smoke or use illicit drugs. Vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 134/76 mm Hg, a heart rate of 88/min, and a temperature of 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical examination, he has problems naming objects and planning tasks. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score is 26/30. Cranial nerve examination is normal. Muscle strength is normal in all 4 limbs with normal muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes. Sensory examination is also normal.
