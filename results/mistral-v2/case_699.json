He had a similar episode 3 days ago and was diagnosed with an inferior wall myocardial infarction. He was admitted and a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was successfully done that day. A fractional flow reserve test during the procedure showed complete resolution of the stenosis. Laboratory tests including serum glucose, lipids, and blood count were within normal limits. He was discharged the day after the procedure on a drug regimen of aspirin, simvastatin, and isosorbide dinitrate. At the time of discharge, he had no chest pain or dyspnea. Presently, his vitals are normal and ECG at rest shows new T-wave inversion.
