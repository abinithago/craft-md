{"case_id": "case_2795", "case_vignette": "A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman seeks evaluation at a medical clinic with complaints of back pain and increased fatigue for 6 months. For the past week, the back pain has radiated to her legs and is stabbing in nature (7/10 in intensity). There are no associated paresthesias. She unintentionally lost 4.5 kg (10.0 lb) in the past 6 months. There is no history of trauma to the back. The past medical history is insignificant and she does not take any medications. The physical examination is normal. The laboratory results are as follows:\nHemoglobin 10 g/dL\nHematocrit 30%\nMean corpuscular volume 80 fL\nSerum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL\nSerum total protein 9 g/dL\nSerum albumin 4.2 g/dL\nSerum calcium 11.2 mg/dL\nA peripheral blood smear shows normocytic normochromic cells. An X-ray reveals multiple osteolytic lesions in the vertebrae and long bones. Serum protein electrophoresis shows a monoclonal spike. A bone marrow biopsy shows increased plasma cells making up greater than 50% of the total cell population.
