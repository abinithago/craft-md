The patient has a past medical history of alcohol abuse and regularly presents to the emergency department. His temperature is 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for foul-smelling breath and poor dentition with erythema and edema of the patient\u2019s gums. Pain is elicited when the patient swallows and the patient complains that his voice has sounded different recently. Crepitus is palpated in the submandibular region. Dermatologic exam reveals the finding in Figure A. The patient\u2019s ECG demonstrates a left bundle branch block which is consistent with previous ECGs.
