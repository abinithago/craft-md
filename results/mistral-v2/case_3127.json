He was born by normal delivery at 39 weeks of gestation and his neonatal period was uneventful. His birth weight was 2.9 kg (6.3 lb) and he is exclusively breastfed. His parents also report that he has had 25\u201330 episodes of loose stools per day since his seventh day of life. His umbilical cord fell off on the 25th day of life. His temperature is 38.6\u00baC (101.4\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, and respiratory rate is 35/min. On physical examination, erythema and induration are noted around the umbilicus and mild hepatosplenomegaly is present.
