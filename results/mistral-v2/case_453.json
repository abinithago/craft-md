She does not have any weight change, palpitations, or altered bowel habits. There is no family history of serious illness. Menses occur at regular 30-day intervals and lasts for 4 days. She appears well. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0 F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 116/74 mm Hg. Examination shows a small swelling on the right side of the neck that moves with swallowing. There is no lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound of the neck shows a 0.9-cm (0.35-in) right lobe thyroid mass with microcalcifications and irregular margins.
