She currently has nausea and a headache. She has vomited twice during the last 30 minutes. She has no history of a serious illness. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. She has never used illicit drugs. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 50/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. She is oriented to person, place, and time. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows bradycardia but no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a bruise on the right temporal side of the head. While performing the remainder of the physical examination the patient starts having a seizure. Intravenous lorazepam is administered and she is admitted to the intensive care unit.
