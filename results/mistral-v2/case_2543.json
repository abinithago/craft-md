During the consult, she complains about recent-onset constipation, painful defecation, and occasional pain with micturition for the past few months. Her menstrual cycles have always been regular with moderate pelvic pain during menses, which is relieved with pain medication. However, in the last 6 months, she has noticed that her menses are \u201cheavier\u201d with severe lower abdominal cramps that linger for 4\u20135 days after the last day of menstruation. She and her husband are trying to conceive a second child, but lately, she has been unable to have sexual intercourse due to pain during sexual intercourse. During the physical examination, she has tenderness in the lower abdomen with no palpable mass. Pelvic examination reveals a left-deviated tender cervix, a tender retroverted uterus, and a left adnexal mass. During the rectovaginal examination, nodules are noted.
