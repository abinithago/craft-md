The current illness started with a fever and a swollen right knee that was very painful. The following day, his knee improved but his left elbow became swollen and painful. While in the waiting room, his left knee is also becoming swollen and painful. Vital signs include: temperature 38.7\u00b0C (101.6\u00b0F), and blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, the affected joints are swollen and very tender to touch, and there are circular areas of redness on his back and left forearm (as shown in the image).
