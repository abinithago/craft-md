He was born at term and has gone through normal developmental milestones. His vaccination profile is up to date. He denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and shortness of breath. He has no history of alcohol use or illicit drug use. His elder brother experienced the same symptoms. The physical examination reveals normal higher mental functions. His extraocular movements are normal. His speech is mildly dysarthric. His muscle tone and strength in all 4 limbs are normal. His ankle reflexes are absent bilaterally with positive Babinski\u2019s signs. Both vibration and proprioception are absent bilaterally. When he is asked to stand with his eyes closed and with both feet close together, he sways from side to side, unable to stand still. X-ray results show mild scoliosis. Electrocardiogram results show widespread T-wave inversions. His fasting blood glucose level is 143 mg/dL.
