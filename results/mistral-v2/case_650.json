Examination shows a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration on the forehead and multiple abrasions over the thorax and abdomen. There is crepitation on palpation of the thorax on the right. Auscultation of the lung shows decreased breath sounds on the right side. A crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat is heard best over the precordium. There is dullness on percussion of the right hemithorax. The lips and tongue have a bluish discoloration. There is an open femur fracture on the left.
