These symptoms occur due to the body's inability to effectively use glucose for energy, leading to an increase in glucose in the urine and the need to drink more water to make up for the lost fluids. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels, and it is typically diagnosed through a combination of symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory tests, including measuring the patient's blood glucose levels. In this case, the patient's symptoms strongly suggest diabetes mellitus, and further testing, such as a fasting blood glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test, would be used to confirm the diagnosis.
