The patient was brought in by paramedics and is currently on 100% O2 via nasal cannula. The patient has a 52 pack-year smoking history and drinks 2 to 3 alcoholic drinks every night. He has a past medical history of asthma but admits to not having seen a physician since high school. His temperature is 98.2\u00b0F (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 157/108 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 29/min, and oxygen saturation is 77%. Physical exam demonstrates tachycardia with a systolic murmur heard best along the right upper sternal border. Breath sounds are diminished over the right upper lobe.
