He states that he first noticed the tremor of his left hand 1 year ago. Since then, the tremor has been worsening and now he can hardly relax when trying to read. His wife says that she is also worried about his memory. She had to take over the finances several weeks ago after learning that he had forgotten to pay the bills for the past few months. The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for hypertension. He takes aspirin and amlodipine. His mother had schizophrenia. The patient drinks 1-2 beers a night and is a former cigar smoker. On physical examination, he speaks softly and has reduced facial expressions. He has a resting tremor that is worse on the left, and he resists manipulation of his bilateral upper extremities.
