Her pulse is 76/min, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg. Examination shows significant weakness of the left upper and lower extremities. She is unable to plantarflex the ankle while supine. She is able to stand on her toes. Her gait is unsteady. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ and symmetric. A CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities.
