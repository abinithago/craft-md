The mass was easily reduced and the patient was referred to the general surgery clinic for elective surgical repair. Because her condition was deemed not urgent, she was informed that she was down on the surgical waiting list. Despite this, she continues to visit the clinic and the ED worried that her bowels are \u2018trapped and dying.\u2019 Each time she is reassured and any protrusion present is quickly reduced. She has previously frequently visited her primary care physician for complaints of abdominal pain and inconsistent bowel habits, but no etiology could be identified. She continues to intermittently have these symptoms and spends hours every day worrying about what may be going on. She has no other significant past medical history.
