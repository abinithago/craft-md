{"case_id": "case_2406", "case_vignette": "A 26-year-old man presents to the behavioral health clinic for assistance overcoming his fear of public speaking. He has always hated public speaking. Two weeks ago, he was supposed to present a research project at school but had to leave the podium before the presentation. He recalled that his heart was racing, his palms were sweating, and that he could not breathe. These symptoms resolved on their own after several minutes, but he felt too embarrassed to return to college the next day. This had also happened in high school where, before a presentation, he started sweating and felt palpitations and nausea that also resolved on their own. He is scheduled for another presentation next month and is terrified. He states that this only happens in front of large groups and that he has no problems communicating at small gatherings. Other than his fear of public speaking, he has a normal social life and many friends. He enjoys his classes and a part-time job.
