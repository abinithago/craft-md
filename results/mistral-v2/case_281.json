The mother reports that her daughter has had a low-grade fever, shortness of breath, and a dry cough for the past 8 days. She has had generalized weakness and pain in her right knee and ankle. She has a ventricular septum defect that was diagnosed at birth. The patient appears lethargic. Her temperature is 38.4 (101.1\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 34/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Examination shows small, non-blanching, purple lesions on her palms, soles, and under her fingernails. There is edema of the eyelids and feet. Funduscopic examination shows retinal hemorrhages. Holosystolic and early diastolic murmurs are heard. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 11.3 g/dL\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 61 mm/h\nLeukocyte count 15,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 326,000/mm3\nUrine\nBlood 4+\nGlucose negative\nProtein 1+\nKetones negative\nTransthoracic echocardiography shows a small outlet ventricular septum defect and a mild right ventricular enlargement. There are no wall motion abnormalities, valvular heart disease, or deficits in the pump function of the heart. Blood cultures grow Streptococcus pyogenes.
