He stayed in his bedroom most of the day and was often tearful. The roommate recalls the patient talking about death frequently. The patient states he has been skipping many meals and has lost a significant amount of weight as a result. At the time his delusions about the aliens began, the depressive-related symptoms were no longer present. He has no other medical conditions.
