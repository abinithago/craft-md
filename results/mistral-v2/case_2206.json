Her son said that the patient had complained of gnawing abdominal pain that worsened before and improved after meals for the past 3 weeks. She frequently travels for work and is often stressed. She drinks alcohol socially and does not smoke tobacco or marijuana. She has not had anything to eat or drink for the past 24 hours due to the pain, but coughed up \"several cup of\" frank red blood before arrival. Her temperature is 98\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, pulse is 140/min, respirations are 23/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Gastric ultrasound reveals high gastric residual volume. The patient is empirically started on 3 units of uncrossmatched O-negative blood transfusion and pantoprazole.
