The pain is intermittent, presenting at the lateral side of the hip and radiating towards the thigh. It is aggravated while climbing stairs or lying on the right side. Two weeks ago, the patient was treated with a course of oral prednisone for exacerbation of asthma. Her current medications include formoterol-budesonide and albuterol inhalers. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows tenderness to palpation over the upper lateral part of the right thigh. There is no swelling. The patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Abducting the extended right leg against the physician's resistance reproduces the pain. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the pelvis shows no abnormalities.
