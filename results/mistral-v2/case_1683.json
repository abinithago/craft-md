{"case_id": "case_1683", "case_vignette": "A 37-year-old G1P000 presents to her obstetrician for her first prenatal visit. She states that her last menstrual period (LMP) was 11 weeks ago, though she is unsure of the exact date as her periods are sometimes irregular. She and her husband had 5 months of timed, unprotected intercourse before she had a positive home pregnancy test 2 weeks ago. She has been feeling generally well but notes some morning nausea and vomiting. She also mentions that for the last 6 months or so, she has felt increasing pelvic pressure and worsening urinary frequency but has not sought medical care for these symptoms. The patient has a history of obesity and hypertension but is not on any medications. Her mother had a hysterectomy at age 64 for fibroids, and her sister had a twin pregnancy after assisted reproduction. At this visit, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.3\u00b0 F (36.8\u00b0 C), blood pressure is 142/85 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 14/min. She has gained 4 pounds since the last time she weighed herself 4 months ago. On exam, the patient\u2019s fundus is palpated at the umbilicus, her cervix is closed and firm, and there are no adnexal masses.
