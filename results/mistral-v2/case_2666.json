The patient\u2019s mother says she was told that he has not been doing his assignments and frequently tells his teachers that he forgets about them. In addition, he tends to have a difficult time sitting still in class and frequently disrupts the other children. This behavior has been going on for about 8 months, but recently it worsened prompting his teacher to bring it to his mother\u2019s attention. The patient\u2019s mother was surprised to hear about these issues; however, she admits that she needs to repeat herself several times when asking her son to complete his chores. He also has trouble sitting still when doing homework.
