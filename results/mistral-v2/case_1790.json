{"case_id": "case_1790", "case_vignette": "A 75-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes presents to his primary care physician for blurry vision and difficulty driving at night. The patient reports a gradual blurring of vision in both eyes over the last 10 years. He states that he is retired and was not bothered by the blurriness but is now having difficulty driving at night due to glare from oncoming traffic. The patient denies any eye pain, flashes, floaters, tearing, redness, or periods of complete vision loss. He lives at home alone, smokes 1 pack per day, drinks 2 alcoholic drinks every night, and eats mostly canned food. His temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 184/110 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact and the patient has a stable gait. The patient's vision is 20/100 in both eyes. Slit-lamp exam is performed as seen in Figure A.
