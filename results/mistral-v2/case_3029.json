The boy frequently bullies his younger classmates despite having been punished several times for this. His mother also reported that a year prior, she received complaints that the boy shoplifted from local shops in his neighborhood.

Although his abnormal behavior continues despite warnings and punishments, he neither argues with his parents nor teachers and does not display verbal or physical aggression.
