Slit-lamp examination of the right eye shows follicles in the limbic region and the bulbar conjunctiva. There is corneal haziness with neovascularization at the 12 o'clock position. Examination of the left eye is unremarkable. Direct opthalmoscopy of both eyes shows no abnormalities. Right pre-auricular lymphadenopathy is present.
