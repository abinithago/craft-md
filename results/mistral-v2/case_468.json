There is no personal or family history of serious illness. The patient appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a swollen and tender left knee; range of motion is limited by pain. The medial joint line is tender to touch. The patient's hip is slightly flexed and abducted, and the knee is slightly flexed while the patient is in the supine position. Gentle valgus stress is applied across the left knee and medial joint laxity is noted. The remainder of the examination shows no further abnormalities.
