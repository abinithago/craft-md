His roommates state that he has been under a lot of stress lately from his final exams and has been more reclusive. They state that this evening he was very irritable and was yelling at his computer prior to breaking it, followed by him spending several hours at the gym. His temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/98 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 23/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an irritable young man. Cardiopulmonary exam is notable for tachycardia and bilateral clear breath sounds. Neurological exam reveals dilated pupils. The patient is notably diaphoretic and speaks very rapidly during the physical exam and is aggressive. He is given haloperidol, diphenhydramine, and diazepam for sedation and placed in soft restraints. His symptoms resolved over the next 10 hours in the emergency department.
