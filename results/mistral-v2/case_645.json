She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and Raynaud syndrome. Her current medications include metformin, nifedipine, and a multivitamin. She appears well. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the left mastoid process. Immediately after the patient does not hear a tone, the tuning fork is held over the left ear and she reports hearing the tuning fork again. The same test is repeated on the right side and shows the same pattern. The vibration tuning fork is then placed on the middle of the forehead and the patient hears the sound louder in the right ear.
