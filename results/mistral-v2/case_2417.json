She works as a lawyer and her job is stressful. She drinks wine with dinner every night and smokes 10 cigarettes a day. Emergency personnel stabilized her and administered oxygen while on the way to the hospital. Upon arrival, the vital signs include: blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate 120/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 37.7\u00b0C (99.9\u00b0F).
