Since then, she has been staying up late at night working on a secret project. She is energetic despite sleeping less than 4 hours per day. Her parents report that she seems easily distracted. She is usually very responsible, but this week she spent her paycheck on supplies for her project. She has never had similar symptoms before. In the past, she has had episodes where she felt too fatigued to go to school and slept until 2 pm every day for 2 weeks at a time. During those times, her parents noticed that she cried excessively, was very indecisive, and expressed feelings of worthlessness. Two months ago, she had an asthma exacerbation and was treated with bronchodilators and steroids. She tried cocaine once in high school but has not used it since. Vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is irritable but cooperative. Her speech is pressured and her thought process is linear.
