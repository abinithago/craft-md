{"case_id": "case_1748", "case_vignette": "A 44-year-old G2P2 African American woman presents to her gynecologist for dysmenorrhea. She reports that for the past few months, she has been having severe pain during her menses. She also endorses menstrual bleeding that has been heavier than usual. The patient reports that her cycles are regular and occur every 30 days, and she denies both dyspareunia and spotting between her periods. Her last menstrual period was two weeks ago. In terms of her obstetric history, the patient had two uncomplicated pregnancies, and she had no difficulty becoming pregnant. She has never had an abnormal pap smear. Her past medical history is otherwise significant for hyperlipidemia and asthma. On physical exam, the patient\u2019s uterus is tender, soft, and enlarged to the size of a pregnant uterus at 10 weeks of gestation. She is non-tender during vaginal exam, without cervical motion tenderness or adnexal masses. Her BMI is 24 kg/m2.
