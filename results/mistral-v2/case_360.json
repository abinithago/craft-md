Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiovascular examination shows no abnormalities. Examination of the feet shows swelling of the left ankle with collapse of the midfoot arch and prominent malleoli. There is no redness or warmth. There is a small, dry ulcer on the left plantar surface of the 2nd metatarsal. Monofilament testing shows decreased sensation along both feet up to the shins bilaterally. His gait is normal.
