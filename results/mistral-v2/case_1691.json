{"case_id": "case_1691", "case_vignette": "A 32-year-old G1P0000 presents to labor and delivery triage at 38 weeks gestation after several hours of contractions. Currently, they are timed about four minutes apart. Her contractions started after she tripped on a rug and fell on her side. She denies leakage of fluid and the baby has been moving normally, but she noted a small amount of blood on her underwear just before coming into the hospital. The pregnancy has been uncomplicated thus far. The patient has a past medical history of endometriosis, and this fetus was conceived by in vitro fertilization. Pelvic exam in triage reveals a cervix that is three centimeters dilated with a small amount of blood near the introitus. Fetal heart rate tracing at this time is shown in Figure A.
