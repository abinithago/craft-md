{"case_id": "case_1133", "case_vignette": "A 60-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye that occurred 30 minutes ago while watching TV. She has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus; she has had trouble adhering to her medication regimen. Her blood pressure is 160/85 mm Hg. Examination shows 20/50 vision in the left eye and no perception of light in the right eye. Direct pupillary reflex is present in the left eye, but absent in the right eye. Accommodation is intact bilaterally. Intraocular pressure is 16 mm Hg in the left eye and 18 mm Hg in the right eye. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye shows a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula. The optic disc appears normal.
