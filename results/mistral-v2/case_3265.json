The patient\u2019s daughter says she sometimes gets angry and aggressive while at other times she seems lost and stares at her surroundings. Her daughter also reports that she has seen her mother talking to empty chairs. The patient says she sleeps well during the night but still feels sleepy throughout the day. She has no problems getting dressed and maintaining her one bedroom apartment. Past medical history is significant for mild depression and mild osteoporosis. Current medications include escitalopram, alendronic acid, and a multivitamin. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented and sitting comfortably in her chair. A mild left-hand tremor is noted. Muscle strength is 5 out of 5 in the upper and lower extremities bilaterally, but muscle tone is slightly increased. She can perform repetitive alternating movements albeit slowly. She walks with a narrow gait and has mild difficulty turning.
