{"case_id": "case_3209", "case_vignette": "A 59-year-old man presents to his family practitioner with his wife. He has fallen several times over the past 3 months. Standing up from a seated position is especially difficult for him. He also complains of intermittent dizziness, excessive sweating, constipation, and difficulty performing activities of daily living. He denies fever, jerking of the limbs, memory disturbances, urinary incontinence, and abnormal limb movements. Past medical includes a cholecystectomy 25 years ago and occasional erectile dysfunction. He takes a vitamin supplement with calcium and occasionally uses sildenafil. While supine, his blood pressure is 142/74 mm Hg and his heart rate is 64/min. After standing, his blood pressure is 118/60 mm Hg and his heart rate is 62/min. He is alert and oriented with a flat affect while answering questions. Extraocular movements are intact in all directions. No tremors are noticed. Muscle strength is normal in all limbs but with increased muscle tone. He is slow in performing intentional movements. His writing is small and he takes slow steps during walking with adducted arms and a slightly reduced arm swing. A trial of levodopa did not improve his symptoms.
