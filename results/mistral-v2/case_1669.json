He works as a machinist and is currently struggling with his finances. The patient has a past medical history of asthma, and his current medications include albuterol, fluticasone, fish oil, and whey protein supplements. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/65 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. You notice the bilateral findings seen in Figure A. Otoscopy reveals bilateral clear tympanic membranes.
