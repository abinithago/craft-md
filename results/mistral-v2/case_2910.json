The vital signs include: blood pressure 152/92 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 37.8\u00b0C (100.1\u00b0F). On physical exam, the patient appears alert and oriented. Observation of the lesion reveals a poorly demarcated region of erythema and edema along the anterior aspect of the right tibia. Within the region of erythema is a 2\u20133 millimeter linear break in the skin that does not reveal any serous or purulent discharge. Tenderness to palpation and warmth is associated with the lesion. There are no vesicles, pustules, papules, or nodules present.
