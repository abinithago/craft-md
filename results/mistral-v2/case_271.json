She has a 2-year history of depression. She was let go by her employer 6 months ago because she could no longer handle all her tasks and often forgot about assignments. Her father committed suicide at the age of 50. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily over the past 20 years. She has a history of smoking cocaine for 8 years but stopped 1 year ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is confused and oriented to person and place only. Neurologic examination shows a delayed return to neutral ankle position after triggering the plantar reflex.
