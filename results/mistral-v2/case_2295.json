He has had similar abdominal discomfort during the past 5 years, although he does not remember passing blood in the urine. He has had hypertension for the past 2 years, for which he has been prescribed medication. There is no history of weight loss, skin rashes, joint pain, vomiting, change in bowel habits, and smoking. On physical examination, there are ballotable flank masses bilaterally. The bowel sounds are normal. Renal function tests are as follows:\nUrea 50 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.4 mg/dL\nProtein Negative\nRBC Numerous\nThe patient underwent ultrasonography of the abdomen, which revealed enlarged kidneys and multiple anechoic cysts with well-defined walls. A CT scan confirmed the presence of multiple cysts in the kidneys.
