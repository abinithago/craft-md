He describes the feeling as if things went black in his left eye suddenly. His temperature is 98.0\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 154/94 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves III-XII as intact. The patient is unable to see out of his left eye but has normal vision in his right eye. The rest of his exam including strength, sensation, and gait are unremarkable. An ECG is performed as seen in Figure A and an ultrasound of the eye is performed as seen in Figure B. Fundoscopy is performed as seen in Figure C. A CT scan of the head is currently pending.
