After completing a set of weight lifting, he felt a \"pop\" in his right arm, followed by pain. Since the incident, he has been unable to carry items or lift his arm over his head without difficulty and pain. The patient has a past medical history of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and constipation. His current medications include lisinopril, metformin, insulin, and fiber supplements. On physical exam, you note pain with flexion of the forearm and abduction of the arm with 1/5 strength. There is also weakness of abduction of the affected arm with 3/5 strength.
