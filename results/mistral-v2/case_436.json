He was expelled from school at the age of 13 years for stealing school property and threatening to assault a teacher. He has fathered 6 children with 4 women. He says that he does not provide child support because he needs the money for his own personal expenses. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the forearm shows a 6 cm long, 0.5 cm deep wound with neat edges on the dorsal surface of the left forearm. There are bruises on the left shoulder, back, and the proximal phalanges of the right hand. On mental status examination, the patient is alert and calm. His mood is described as cheerful.
