During the past 2 days, she has had urinary incontinence not related to sneezing or laughing. Last summer, she had weakness and numbness of her right lower extremity that was worse when she was outside; she regained her strength 3 weeks later. She has no history of serious illness. She has had 10 male sexual partners in her lifetime and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows an impaired tandem gait. There is mild spasticity and muscle strength is decreased in both upper extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. The abdominal reflex is absent. Muscle strength in the right lower extremity is mildly decreased. Sensation to vibration and fine touch is decreased over the upper extremities.
