She was admitted to the hospital for a deep vein thrombosis about 1 year ago and was treated with heparin followed by warfarin. Therapy ended after 6 months and she has been monitored by her primary care provider since. She has been sexually active with a new partner for 3 months and uses condoms inconsistently. Her father has type II diabetes and takes insulin. Her mother died of a stroke when she was 50. Her sister had 2 spontaneous first trimester abortions. Temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, respirations are 16/min, and BMI is 22 kg/m2 (48.5 pounds). On examination, her lower abdomen is tender to palpation. Vaginal examination reveals an open cervical os with blood pooling in the vaginal vault.\nLaboratory investigation:\nComplete blood count\nHemoglobin  9.5 g/dl\nLeucocytes  4,500/mm3\nPlatelets  90,000/mm3\nSerum haptoglobin  25 mg/dl (30-200 mg/dl)\nBleeding time  5 minutes\nAPTT  60 seconds\nPlasma fibrinogen  250 mg/dl (150-400 mg/dl)\nVDRL  positive\nHbsAg  negative\nAfter a mixing study, her APTT fails to correct.
