He also has trouble falling asleep at night and asks to sleep in the same room with his parents every night. He has not had fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or weight loss. He sits very close to his mother and starts to cry when she steps out of the room to take a phone call. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities.
