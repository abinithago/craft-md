A colonoscopy 2 years ago was normal. He works as a nurse at a local hospital. He is married and has two children. His father died of prostate cancer at the age of 70 years. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years but quit following his myocardial infarction. He drinks one to two beers on the weekends. He has never used illicit drugs. Current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, metoprolol, fluoxetine, metformin, and a multivitamin. He appears well-nourished. Temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows a high-frequency, mid-to-late systolic murmur that is best heard at the apex. The abdomen is soft and nontender.
