He is sexually active with his girlfriend and uses condoms occasionally. He smokes 2\u20133 cigarettes on weekends and denies alcohol use. Today, his pulse is 97/min, the blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg, the temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). On physical exam, the patient is well developed with mild gynecomastia. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm. Lung examination reveals vesicular sounds with occasional crepitations bilaterally. and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdominal exam is non-contributory. His right testicle is tender and larger than the left. The swelling does not transilluminate and does not change in size after performing a Valsalva maneuver.
