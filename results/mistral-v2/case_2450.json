He recently immigrated to the US from Africa. The lesions are painless and the physicians in his country treated him for syphilis and eczema, with no improvement. He lives with his 4th wife. He smokes 2 packs of cigarette per day and has been doing so for the last 30 years. He is not aware of any family members with malignancies or hereditary diseases. The physical examination is remarkable for an erythematous plaque, with areas of crusting, oozing, and irregular borders on the dorsal surface of the penile shaft and a similar lesion on his left middle finger (shown in the picture). The regional lymph nodes are not affected. A biopsy is obtained and the pathologic evaluation reveals cells with nuclear hyperchromasia, multinucleation, and increased mitotic figures within the follicle-bearing epithelium.
