His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 78, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation on room air is 97%. He is in no distress but shows marked pallor and has multiple pinpoint, red, nonblanching spots on his extremities. On palpation, his spleen is significantly enlarged. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 80,000/mm3, and a platelet count of 34,000/mm3. A blood smear shows immature cells with large, prominent nucleoli and pink, elongated, needle-shaped cytoplasmic inclusions.
