{"case_id": "case_2178", "case_vignette": "A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department due to severe, intractable headaches, and bilateral ocular pain. Her symptoms began approximately 2 weeks prior to presentation and have progressively worsened. She initially had right-sided headaches that were sharp, interfered with sleep, and were unresponsive to pain medications. The headache was around her right eye and cheek, and she noticed diplopia with right lateral gaze. Her symptoms were accompanied by fatigue, fever, and edema around the right eye. Approximately 2 days after these symptoms, she developed swelling around the left eye. Medical history is significant for a recent rhinosinusitis infection. Her temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 133/72 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, there is ptosis, proptosis, chemosis, and periorbital swelling of both eyes. There is hyperesthesia in the bilateral ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Fundoscopic exam demonstrates bilateral papilledema. There is mydriasis and eye muscle weakness in all directions.
