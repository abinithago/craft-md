She states that the pain has been dull and progressive, but became suddenly worse while she was exercising. The patient's past medical history is notable for depression, anxiety, and gonococcal urethritis that was appropriately treated. The patient states that she is sexually active and does not use condoms. She admits to drinking at least 5 standard alcoholic drinks a day. The patient also recently lost a large amount of weight for a fitness show she planned on entering. The patient's current medications include oral contraceptive pills, fluoxetine, alprazolam, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and folate. On physical exam you note an athletic young woman with burly shoulders, a thick neck, and acne on her forehead and back. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness with 10/10 pain upon palpation of the right upper quadrant. Blood pressure is 80/40 mmHg, pulse is 110/minute, temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C) and respirations are 15/minute with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.
