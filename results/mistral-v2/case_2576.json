She stopped trying to conceive a child after 2 spontaneous abortions in the past 4 years and has been on iron oral supplementation for the last 2 years. She adds that she feels a dull pressure-like discomfort in her pelvis and constipation. The physical examination is significant for pale mucous membranes and a grade 2/6 ejection systolic murmur in the area of the pulmonic valve. Pelvic examination reveals an enlarged, mobile uterus with an irregular contour. The hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL and the hematocrit is 27%.
