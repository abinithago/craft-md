{"case_id": "case_493", "case_vignette": "A 74-year-old Hispanic man comes to the physician because of a three-week history of dizziness upon standing and a brief loss of consciousness one hour ago. The patient suddenly collapsed on his way to the bathroom after waking up in the morning. He did not sustain any injuries from his collapse. He has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and gout. The patient's mother died of a grand mal seizure at the age of 53 years. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 55 years. He drinks three beers and two glasses of whiskey daily. Current medications include ranitidine, dutasteride, tamsulosin, and allopurinol. He is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 62 kg (137 lb); BMI is 22.5 kg/m2. He appears pale. Temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg supine and 100/70 mm Hg one minute after standing with no change in pulse rate. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor. A plopping sound is heard on auscultation, immediately followed by a low-pitched, rumbling mid-diastolic murmur heard best at the apex. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows regular sinus rhythm.
