This weakness lasted for roughly 3 hours, but it resolved completely while she was in the car on her way to the emergency department, she can move her leg normally now.

Physical exam, including a thorough neurological exam, is unremarkable; strength is 5/5 throughout her bilateral upper and lower extremities. A noncontrast CT scan of her head is shown.
