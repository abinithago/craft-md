His medical history is significant for gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and pulmonary histoplasmosis 10 years ago. He currently smokes 2 packs of cigarettes/day, drinks a 6-pack of beer/day, and he endorses a past history of cocaine use back in the early 2000s but currently denies any drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 18/min. His physical examination shows minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur, and a benign abdominal physical examination. However, on routine lab testing, you notice that his sodium is 127 mEq/L. His chest X-ray is shown in the picture.
