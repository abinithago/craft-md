{"case_id": "case_3252", "case_vignette": "A 45-year-old African American man presents with nausea and severe abdominal pain. He denies vomiting. He says that, 2 days ago, his divorce was finalized, so he went to a bar and had multiple shots of tequila and vodka. This morning, upon waking, he noticed his urine was red, which lasted throughout the day. The patient denies any history of similar symptoms. Past medical history is significant for low blood counts diagnosed on routine laboratory work 6 months ago, which was not followed up due to the stress of the divorce. A review of systems is significant for erectile dysfunction and chronic fatigue. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), the heart rate is 90/min, the blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 20/min. Physical examination shows scleral icterus. Mucous membranes are pale. Cardiac auscultation reveals a systolic flow murmur loudest along the left sternal border. There is moderate right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness with no rebound or guarding. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nHematocrit 27%\nMean corpuscular volume 81 \u00b5m3\nLeukocytes 6,000/mm3\nPlatelets 130,000/\u00b5L\nHaptoglobin 30 mg/dL (50\u2013150 mg/dL)\nReticulocyte count 3%\n  Total bilirubin 7.1 mg/dL\nLDH 766 U/L\nAST 150 U/L\nALT 195 U/L\nHbA1 96%\nHbA2 2%\nHbF 2%\nCD55 50% of expected\nThe peripheral smear is unremarkable.
