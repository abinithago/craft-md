A week before she presented her pain symptoms, she fell on her right forearm and developed mild bruising. She has type-1 diabetes mellitus and is on an insulin treatment. The physical examination reveals that her right hand and forearm were warmer, more swollen, and had a more reddish appearance than the left side. She feels an intense pain upon light touching of her right hand and forearm. Her radial and brachial pulses are palpable. The neurological examination is otherwise normal. The laboratory test results are as follows:\nHemoglobin 15.2 g/dL\nWhite blood cell count 6,700 cells/cm3\nPlatelets 300,000 cells/cm3\nAlanine aminotransferase 32 units/L\nAspartate aminotransferase 38 units/L\nC-reactive protein 0.4 mg/L\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 7 mm/1st hour\nThe X-ray of the right hand and forearm do not show a fracture.
