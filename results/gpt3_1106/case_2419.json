He underwent a CT of his abdomen which revealed a large mass (11.3 cm x 7.2 cm in diameter) with a metastatic retroperitoneal lymph node. He was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma and initially received radiotherapy while on the transplant list to prevent local expansion of his malignancy. 3 months after radiotherapy, the patient experienced hematemesis and melena. He was admitted to the emergency department for evaluation. His vitals were: blood pressure 84/56 mmHg, heart rate 92/min, and respiratory rate 20/min. Laboratory evaluation revealed severe anemia with a hemoglobin level of 5.7 g/dL, INR 1.8 and platelets of 68,000 cells/mm3. He received a blood transfusion. An endoscopic examination demonstrated diffuse edematous hyperemic mucosa and multiple hemorrhagic patches with active oozing in the antrum.
