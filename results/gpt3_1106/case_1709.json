At that time, her primary care physician prescribed sofosbuvir, an albuterol inhaler, and daily inhaled fluticasone, which she has been using as directed. She is sexually active with one male partner. Her last HIV test was negative, and she does not have a history of sexually transmitted diseases. She denies current alcohol or intravenous drug use. She smokes a pack a day of cigarettes and reports she has been smoking since she was 16.
