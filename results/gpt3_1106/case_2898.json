His hemoglobin is 7.6 g/dL, hematocrit is 30%, BUN is 33 mg/dL, and PT/aPTT is within normal limits. A nasogastric tube is inserted, which drains bile without blood. Rectal examination and proctoscopy reveal massive active bleeding, without any obvious hemorrhoids or fissure. The physician estimates the rate of bleeding at 2-3 mL/min.
