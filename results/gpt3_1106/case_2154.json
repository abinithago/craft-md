He states that for the past month ever since starting a new job he has experienced an episode of syncope or near-syncope every morning while he is getting dressed. The patient states that he now gets dressed, shaves, and puts on his tie sitting down to avoid falling when he faints. He has never had this before and is concerned it is stress from his new job as he has been unemployed for the past 5 years. He is wondering if he can get a note for work since he was unable to head in today secondary to his presentation. The patient has no significant past medical history and is otherwise healthy. His temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 122/83 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.
