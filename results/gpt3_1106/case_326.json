She and her boyfriend have broken up 20 times in the past 6 months. She says she cut herself not because she wants to kill herself; she feels alone and empty and wants her boyfriend to take care of her. Her boyfriend claims that she is prone to outbursts of physical aggression as well as mood swings. He says that these mood swings last a few hours and vary from states of exuberance and self-confidence to states of self-doubt and melancholy. On examination, the patient appears well-dressed and calm. She has normal speech, thought processes, and thought content.
