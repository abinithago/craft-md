A physical examination revealed multiple erythematous macules and papules on the face, arms, chest, and back, as well as thinning of the eyebrows and loss of some eyelashes. Additional findings include hypopigmented macules around the elbows, which are insensitive to light touch, temperature, and pinprick. The grip strength is slightly diminished bilaterally with the conservation of both bicipital reflexes.
