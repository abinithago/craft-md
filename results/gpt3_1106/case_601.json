Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is fully alert and oriented to self and place but not to time. Every few minutes she asks how she got to the emergency department. She is able to follow commands and sustain attention. She recalls 3/3 objects immediately and recalls 0/3 objects at 5 minutes. The remainder of the neurological exam shows no abnormalities.
