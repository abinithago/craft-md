He recently came to the United States from Nigeria to attend a year of high school. He reports that it has been increasingly difficult for him to read the whiteboard during classes. Physical examination shows symmetrically distributed papules 4\u20138 mm in diameter, excoriation marks, and patchy hyperpigmentation over his shoulders, waist, and buttocks. There is nontender inguinal lymphadenopathy and several firm, nontender subcutaneous nodules along the right iliac crest. Six skin snip biopsies are taken from the pelvic girdle, buttocks, and thigh, and are then incubated in saline. After 24 hours, microscopic examination shows motile microfilariae.
