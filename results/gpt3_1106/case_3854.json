The patient has his eyes open during these episode but does not respond to his parents\u2019 voice or his name. These episodes last between 1-2 minutes after which the patient appears to return back to awareness. The patient is confused after these episodes and appears not to know where he is for about 15 minutes. These episodes occur once every few days and the most recent one happened about 10 minutes before the patient arrived to the emergency department. On arrival, the patient is mildly confused and does not know where he is or what recently happened. He is slow to respond to questions and appears tired.
