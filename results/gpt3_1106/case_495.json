His foster mother reports that he runs around a lot inside the house and refuses to help his sister with chores and errands. He frequently interrupts his foster mother's conversations with others and talks excessively. She has found him trying to climb on the roof on multiple occasions. He was placed in foster care because of neglect by his biological parents 3 years ago. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings.
