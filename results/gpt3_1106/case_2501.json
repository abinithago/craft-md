He also tells the doctor that his brother had a sudden death a couple of years ago. His heart rate is 98/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 110/72 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur immediately after S1; it is best heard on the apex, and it radiates to the axilla. There is also an early diastolic murmur heard in early diastole, which is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. When the Valsalva maneuver is performed, the murmur becomes louder. An ECG and an echocardiogram are performed, which confirm the diagnosis.
