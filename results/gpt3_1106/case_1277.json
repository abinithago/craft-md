Physical examination shows a nontender, rubbery mass in the left axilla and a similar, smaller mass in the right groin. His spleen is palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies, including complete blood count, are within reference ranges. Genetic analysis obtained on resection of the axillary mass shows a t(14;18) translocation.
