He does not recall any trauma or arthropod bites. The lesions began as non-pruritic erythematous papules that became enlarged, ulcerated, and crusted. There is no history of fever or abdominal pain. He has been sexually active with a single partner since their marriage at 24 years of age. The physical examination reveals erythematous, crusted plaques with central ulceration and a raised border. There is no fluctuance, drainage, or sporotrichoid spread. A punch biopsy was performed, which revealed an ulcerated lesion with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Amastigotes within dermal macrophages are seen on Giemsa staining.
