{"case_id": "case_2751", "case_vignette": "A 60-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness 2 hours ago. He can speak clearly without difficulty and denies any similar symptoms in the past. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and diabetes, both poorly managed due to medication non-compliance. Family history is significant for heart disease and diabetes in multiple paternal and maternal relatives. His vital signs include: blood pressure 150/88 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, strength is 3/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left upper and lower extremities. The sensation is intact, and no impairments in balance or ataxias are present. An initial noncontrast CT scan of the head is unremarkable, but a repeat noncontrast CT scan of the head performed a month later reveals the 2 lesions circled in the image.
