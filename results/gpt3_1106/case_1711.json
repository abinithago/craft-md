{"case_id": "case_1711", "case_vignette": "A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance. The patient was found unconscious in his bedroom after a suicide attempt. The patient had cut his wrists using a kitchen knife. The patient is unresponsive and pale. His temperature is 96\u00b0F (35.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 70/35 mmHg, pulse is 190/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Pressure is applied to his bilateral wrist lacerations. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is 7. A full trauma assessment is performed and reveals no other injuries. IV fluids are started as well as a rapid transfusion sequence. Norepinephrine is administered. Repeat vitals demonstrate that his blood pressure is 100/65 mmHg and pulse is 100/min. The patient is responsive and seems mildly confused. Resuscitation is continued and the patient's GCS improves to 15. Thirty minutes later, the patient's GCS is 11. His temperature is 103\u00b0F (39.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse is 122/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient complains of flank pain.
