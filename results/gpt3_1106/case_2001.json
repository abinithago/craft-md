{"case_id": "case_2001", "case_vignette": "A 52-year-old man presents to the clinic with a headache and dizziness for the past month. The patient reports that about 4 weeks ago he developed a \u201cnagging\u201d headache. He thought he had a cold, so he tried over the counter ibuprofen that provided only mild and temporary relief. Recently, he also started feeling dizzy and nauseous, which only resolves when he steps outside to shovel the snow. The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and asthma. His medications include amlodipine, metformin, glimepiride, and a fluticasone/salmeterol inhaler. The patient has been living at his upstate cabin for the past 5 weeks but denies other recent travel. He denies smoking tobacco or illicit drug use. The patient\u2019s temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/78 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 16/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.
