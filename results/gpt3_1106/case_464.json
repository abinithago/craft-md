{"case_id": "case_464", "case_vignette": "A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a fall that occurred while he was taking a shower earlier that morning. His wife heard him fall and entered the bathroom to find all four of his extremities twitching. The episode lasted approximately 30 seconds. He was unsure of what had happened and was unable to answer simple questions on awakening. He has regained orientation since that time. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include metoprolol and atorvastatin. His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressures is 130/80 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. Cranial nerve examination shows no abnormalities. He has 5/5 strength in all extremities. Examination shows full muscle strength. Sensation to pinprick, light touch, and vibration is normal and symmetrical. A noncontrast head CT is performed and shows a slightly hyperdense mass. Follow-up MRI shows a homogeneous, well-circumscribed 4-cm mass with compression of the adjacent white matter, and a hyperintense rim around the mass on T2 weighted imaging.
