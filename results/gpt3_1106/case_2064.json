She is also worried about his balance. She endorses that he has had several falls, the worst being 3 weeks ago when he tripped on the sidewalk getting the mail. The patient denies loss of consciousness, pre-syncope, chest pain, palpitations, urinary incontinence, or bowel incontinence. He complains of headache but denies dizziness. He reports nausea and a few episodes of non-bloody emesis but denies abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. He takes aspirin, warfarin, insulin, lisinopril, simvastatin, and ibuprofen. He drinks a half glass of whisky after dinner every night and smokes a cigar on the weekends. On physical examination, he is oriented to name and place but not to date. He is unable to spell \"world\" backward. When asked to remember 3 words, he recalls only 2.
