He mentions that his father has been recently recovered from chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria, which was treated successfully with quinine. On physical examination, his temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse rate is 110/min, blood pressure is 116/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 18/min. Examination of his abdomen reveals splenomegaly. His blood sample is sent for the examination of the peripheral smear, which confirms the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The patient is placed on treatment with oral quinine. After 5 days, the patient returns with improved symptoms of malaria but with complaints of a headache, tinnitus, nausea, and dizziness.
