{"case_id": "case_2578", "case_vignette": "A 28-year-old woman at 30 weeks gestation is rushed to the emergency room with the sudden onset of vaginal bleeding accompanied by intense abdominopelvic pain and uterine contractions. The intensity and frequency of pain have increased in the past 2 hours. This is her 1st pregnancy and she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes several weeks ago. Her vital signs include a blood pressure of 124/68 mm Hg, a pulse of 77/min, a respiratory rate of 22/min, and a temperature of 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). The abdominal examination is positive for a firm and tender uterus. An immediate cardiotocographic evaluation reveals a fetal heart rate of 150/min with prolonged and repetitive decelerations and high-frequency and low-amplitude uterine contractions. Your attending physician warns you about delaying the vaginal physical examination until a quick sonographic evaluation is completed.
