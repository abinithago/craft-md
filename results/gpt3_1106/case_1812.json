{"case_id": "case_1812", "case_vignette": "A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department after experiencing a motor vehicle accident. The patient was the front seat passenger in a head on collision. The patient is responsive only to painful stimuli. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. The patient is started on IV fluids and is given blood products. A FAST exam reveals no signs of intra-abdominal bleeding. A chest radiograph is ordered as seen in Figure A. A pelvic binder is placed and fluid and blood resuscitation is continued. Fifteen minutes later his temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. The patient is now able to respond to questions. The patient's lab values are ordered and are as below:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 137 mEq/L\nCl-: 102 mEq/L\nK+: 4.2 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 110 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nCa2+: 9.6 mg/dL\nAST: 12 U/L\nALT: 14 U/L\n\nHemoglobin: 11 g/dL\nHematocrit: 30%\nLeukocyte count: 6,500 cells/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 255,000/mm^3\n\nThe patient suddenly becomes short of breath. A chest radiograph is ordered as seen in Figure B. A FAST exam is repeated and is within normal limits. Repeat lab values are ordered as below:\n\nHemoglobin: 13 g/dL\nHematocrit: 36%\nLeukocyte count: 6,000 cells/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 250,000/mm^3\n\n", "question": "Which  best describes the most likely diagnosis?", "correct_ans": "antibody binding of leukocytes", "trial_0": {"multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Cardiovascular System.
