He has asthma and has been hospitalized multiple times. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is somnolent and diaphoretic. Serum studies show a glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL and a potassium concentration of 2.4 mEq/L.

Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness. Serum studies taken during the episode show a glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL, an insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L (N=2.6\u201324.9), and a C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL (N = 0.8\u20133.1).
