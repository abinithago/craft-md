The patient is currently sexually active with her boyfriend and uses the \"pull-out\" method for contraception. A pelvic ultrasound in the emergency room reveals an ectopic pregnancy. The patient is scheduled for surgery and is promptly treated. She is recovering on the surgical floor. The procedure was complicated by a large amount of blood loss. The patient is recovering on IV fluids when her family comes to visit. When her parents find out the diagnosis, yelling ensues and they leave angrily. The patient is scheduled to go home today. Prior to discharge, the patient reports she is unable to use her left hand. Upon examination, she is teary-eyed and she claims that she has \u201cthe worst family in the world,\u201d and she does not want to go home.
