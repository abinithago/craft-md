{"case_id": "case_2915", "case_vignette": "A 25-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck for the past week. He reports no recent fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which was diagnosed last year. He also experienced a head trauma 5 years ago, which has been complicated by residual seizures. His only medication is daily phenytoin, which was restarted after he had a seizure 3 months ago. His temperature is 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109). On physical examination, multiple non-tender lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, are found to be palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. No other lymphadenopathy is noted. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show the following:\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 8000/mm3 with a normal differential\nPlatelet count 250,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 40 mm/h\nAn excisional biopsy of one of the cervical lymph nodes is performed.
