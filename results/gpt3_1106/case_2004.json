She denies dysuria, dyspareunia, or dyschezia. Prior to 5 months ago, her menstrual periods were only 4 days long and consisted of moderate bleeding. Her periods normally occur every 28 days. She is frustrated because she feels like she needs to wear a pad all the time. The patient delivered 3 healthy children vaginally without complications, followed by a tubal ligation. Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. She is sexually active with her husband and denies a history of sexually transmitted diseases. She has never had an abnormal pap smear. Her last pap smear and test for human papillomavirus was 4 years ago. The patient has hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine. On physical examination, the thyroid is normal in size without masses or tenderness. Pelvic examination reveals a firm, mobile, enlarged, irregularly-shaped uterus without adnexal tenderness. Speculum exam is unremarkable.
