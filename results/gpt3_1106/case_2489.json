He also has difficulty with his short-term memory. Past medical history is otherwise noncontributory. His father had similar symptoms before he died but those symptoms started at the age of 33. His blood pressure is 125/92 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature is 36.6\u00b0C (97.9\u00b0F). Physical exam reveals involuntary writhing movements of hands, slow eye movements, and sporadic rigidity. The physician explains that this is an inherited disorder where the symptoms occur progressively at an earlier age than the parent and often with increased severity in the future generations.
