{"case_id": "case_2924", "case_vignette": "An 11-year-old girl is brought to her primary care physician by her mother with complaints of constant lower abdominal pain and foul-smelling urine for the past 2 days. The patient has had several previous episodes of simple urinary tract infections in the past. Her vitals signs show mild tachycardia without fever. Physical examination reveals suprapubic tenderness without costovertebral angle tenderness on percussion. Urinalysis reveals positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite. Further questioning reveals that the patient does not use the school toilets and holds her urine all day until she gets home. When pressed further, she gets teary-eyed and starts to cry and complains that other girls will make fun of her if she uses the bathroom and will spread rumors to the teachers and her friends. She reports that though this has never happened in the past it concerns her a great deal.
