{"case_id": "case_3100", "case_vignette": "A 51-year-old man presents to the clinic with a history of hematuria and hemoptysis following pneumonia several weeks ago. He works as a hotel bellhop. His medical history is significant for gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and mild intellectual disability. He currently smokes 2 packs of cigarettes per day and denies any alcohol use or any illicit drug use. His vital signs include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. Physical examination shows minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur, and benign abdominal findings. Pulmonary function tests demonstrate a restrictive pattern and a current chest radiograph shows bibasilar alveolar infiltrates. Clinical pathology analysis reveals antiglomerular basement membrane antibody, and his renal biopsy shows a linear immunofluorescence pattern.
