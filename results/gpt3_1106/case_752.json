Thirty minutes ago, he was carrying heavy moving boxes from his house to a truck when he felt short of breath and suddenly lost consciousness. His wife states that he fell to the ground and was unresponsive for 15 seconds before he regained consciousness. He was not confused after this episode. He does not have chest pain.
