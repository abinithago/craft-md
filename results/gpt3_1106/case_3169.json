The patient also reports nausea, weight loss, and abdominal cramps followed by sudden diarrhea. He denies tenesmus, urgency, and bloody diarrhea. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0 F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 89/58 mm Hg. A physical examination is performed where nothing significant was found except for dry mucous membranes. Intravenous fluids are started and a stool sample is sent to the lab, which reveals motile protozoa on microscopy, negative for any ova, no blood cells, and pus cells.
