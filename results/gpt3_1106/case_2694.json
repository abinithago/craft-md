{"case_id": "case_2694", "case_vignette": "A 75-year-old man is evaluated in the emergency department for increasing shortness of breath for the last 8 months. He also complains of a dry cough for the last 6 months. Initially, his shortness of breath occurs with exertion, but now he feels it at rest as well. He has no other complaints. He has a sedentary lifestyle and had a hip replacement surgery recently. The past medical history is significant for hypertension for which he is taking lisinopril. The patient is a lifetime non-smoker. The blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, and the temperature is 36.6\u00b0C (97.9\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals fine inspiratory crackles and digital clubbing. A chest X-ray reveals peripheral reticular opacities associated with traction bronchiectasis predominantly at the lung bases. The pulmonary function test results reveal a decreased FEV1, a decreased FVC, and a preserved FEV1/FVC ratio. High-resolution CT scan of the chest is shown.
