{"case_id": "case_108", "case_vignette": "A 72-year-old woman is seen by the Dermatology consult service for a rash which has developed during a prolonged 6-week hospitalization following a hemorrhagic stroke. She is currently intubated, so history is limited, but per chart review, nurses documented the rash starting 5 days ago. She has been experiencing high fevers as well as unexplained transaminitis over the last few days. She has taken atorvastatin and pantoprazole for years, including during the hospitalization. Following the stroke, she was started on carbamazepine for seizure prophylaxis. She contracted MRSA pneumonia 2 weeks ago and has been on vancomycin since then. She has also been on cefepime and micafungin for the last 5 days given the fevers and transaminitis. Physical examination is significant for diffuse erythematous patches extending over the face, chest, back, and extremities, as well as facial edema.", "question": "What is the final diagnosis?", "correct_ans": "drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms", "trial_0": {"multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Dermatology.
