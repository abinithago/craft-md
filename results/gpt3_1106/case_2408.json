{"case_id": "case_2408", "case_vignette": "A 55-year-old woman comes to your office because she noticed the growth of unwanted hair on her upper lip, chin, and chest. She has also noticed an increase in blackheads and pimples on her skin. Her female partner has also recently brought to her attention the deepening of her voice, weight gain, and changes in her external genitalia that generated some personal relationship issues. The patient is frustrated as these changes have appeared over the course of the last 8 months. She claims that she was feeling completely normal before all of these physical changes started. Physical examination shows dark coarse stubbles distributed along her upper lip, chin, chest, back, oily skin, and moderately inflamed acne. Pelvic examination reveals a clitoris measuring 12 mm long, a normal sized mobile retroverted uterus, and a firm, enlarged left ovary.
