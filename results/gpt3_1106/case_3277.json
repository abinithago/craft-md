The patient says that the weakness started in both his feet, manifesting as difficulty walking, but it has progressed to where he cannot move his legs completely and has become bedbound. He also has experienced a recent history of numbness and tingling sensations in both his feet. He denies any recent history of fever, backache, urinary or bowel incontinence, trauma, shortness of breath, or diplopia. His past medical history is remarkable for a viral flu-like illness 2 weeks ago. The patient is afebrile, and his vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, muscle strength in both lower limbs is 1/5. The muscle strength in the upper limbs is \u2158 bilaterally. Sensation to pinprick is decreased in both lower limbs in a stocking distribution. The sensation is intact in the upper limbs bilaterally. Knee and ankle reflexes are absent bilaterally.
