Teachers also say that he constantly fidgets, often leaves his seat without permission, has trouble being quiet, talks excessively, frequently interrupts his classmates when trying to answer questions, and has difficulty waiting in line. The mother states that she has also been noticing similar behaviors at home and that his symptoms have been affecting him negatively academically and socially. The patient has no significant past medical history. The patient is in the 90th percentile for height and weight and has been meeting all the developmental milestones.
