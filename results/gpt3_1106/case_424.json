Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination shows a left-sided, nontender, smooth abdominal mass that does not cross the midline. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range.
