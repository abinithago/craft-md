{"case_id": "case_2464", "case_vignette": "A 54-year-old gardener with diabetes mellitus from the Northeast Jillin Province in China acquired a small scratch from a thorn while working in his flower garden. After 3 weeks, he noticed a small pink, painless bump at the site of a scratch. He was not concerned by the bump; however, additional linearly-distributed bumps that resembled boils began to appear 1 week later that were quite painful. When the changes took on the appearance of open sores that drained clear fluid without any evidence of healing (as shown on the image), he finally visited his physician. The physician referred to the gardener for a skin biopsy to confirm his working diagnosis and to start treatment as soon as possible.
