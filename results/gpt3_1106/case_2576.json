{"case_id": "case_2576", "case_vignette": "A 30-year-old woman seeks evaluation at a local walk-in clinic with a week-long history of lightheadedness and palpitations. She also complains of fatigability and shortness of breath of the same duration. The past medical history is significant for menarche at 9 years of age, heavy menstrual bleeding for the past several years and abdominal pain that worsens during menses. She stopped trying to conceive a child after 2 spontaneous abortions in the past 4 years and has been on iron oral supplementation for the last 2 years. She adds that she feels a dull pressure-like discomfort in her pelvis and constipation. The physical examination is significant for pale mucous membranes and a grade 2/6 ejection systolic murmur in the area of the pulmonic valve. Pelvic examination reveals an enlarged, mobile uterus with an irregular contour. The hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL and the hematocrit is 27%.
