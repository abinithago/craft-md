Her blood pressure is 120/88 mm Hg, pulse is 78/min, temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), and respiratory rate is 16/min. Laboratory findings are unremarkable, except for a potassium level of 3.3 mmol/L and serum calcium of 11 mg/dL. The attending physician suspects that this might be a case of a genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 and orders a genetic analysis.
