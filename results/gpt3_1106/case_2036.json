{"case_id": "case_2036", "case_vignette": "A 22-year-old woman presents to her primary care doctor for a right breast mass that was found during self-exam. Her paternal aunt had been diagnosed with breast cancer 5 years ago, so she wishes to undergo further oncologic evaluation. She plays lacrosse in college but is not at the moment since it is currently off-season. She denies any sexual activity and reports that her last period was about 2 weeks ago. On physical exam, a small mobile non-tender mass is palpated in the inferolateral quadrant of her right breast. Mammography is shown in Figure A. The doctor recommends a fine needle aspiration biopsy, which is shown in Figure B demonstrating fat globules and foamy histiocytes.
