{"case_id": "case_2551", "case_vignette": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the office by his step-parents because he was recently caught beating a stray cat in an alley near his home. He has a police record which includes vandalism, shoplifting, and running away on two occasions. He has also received several detentions and threats of expulsion from school due to bullying and being too aggressive with the younger students. Past medical history is significant for a history of ADHD previously treated with methylphenidate, but now he does not take anything. His biological family placed him and his sister into the foster care system. His step-parents try to provide support and nurturing home life but the patient is very resistant and often acts out.
