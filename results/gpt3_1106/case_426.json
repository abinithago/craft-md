He has been performing poorly in school lately, with reports from teachers that he has not been paying attention in class and has been distracting to other students. He was born at term and has been healthy except for a history of several infantile seizures. His vital signs are within normal limits. He is at the 60th percentile for height and 20th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a palpable abdominal mass, abdominal tenderness in the left upper quadrant, and left costovertebral angle tenderness. There are several ellipsoid, hypopigmented macules on the back and legs and a 4-cm raised plaque of rough, dimpled skin on the right lower back that is the same color as the surrounding skin.
