His blood pressure is 136/92 mm Hg, heart rate is 86/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, and temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). Chest radiography shows a resolving right middle lobe airspace opacity. His initial laboratory tests are notable for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level.
