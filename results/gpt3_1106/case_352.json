She has atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Current medications include metoprolol and warfarin. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg. Visual acuity is counting fingers at 3 feet in the left eye and 20/20 in the right eye. The left eye shows conjunctival injection and edematous cornea. The left pupil is mid-dilated and irregular; it is not reactive to light. Extraocular movements are normal. Fundoscopic examination is inconclusive because of severe corneal edema.
