{"case_id": "case_1760", "case_vignette": "A 67-year-old female presents to her primary care physician complaining of headaches in her left temple and scalp area, neck stiffness, occasional blurred vision, and pain in her jaw when chewing. The appropriate medical therapy is initiated, and a subsequent biopsy of the temporal artery reveals arteritis. Five months later, the patient returns to her physician with a complaint of weakness, leading to difficulty climbing stairs, rising from a chair, and combing her hair. The patient states that this weakness has worsened gradually over the last 2 months. She reports that her headaches, jaw pain, and visual disturbances have resolved. Physical examination is significant for 4/5 strength for both hip flexion/extension as well as shoulder flexion/extension/abduction.
