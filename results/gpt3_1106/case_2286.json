The mass had the appearance of \"a bunch of grapes\". She also says that she has been having a vaginal discharge for the past 6 months. Her family and personal history are not significant for malignancies or inherited disorders. The physical examination is unremarkable except for the presence of soft nodules protruding from the vaginal canal. A tissue sample is obtained for histologic evaluation. Several weeks later the patient returns to the walk-in clinic for a scheduled follow-up visit. The pathology report describes a polypoid mass beneath an epithelial surface with atypical stromal cells positive for polyclonal desmin.
