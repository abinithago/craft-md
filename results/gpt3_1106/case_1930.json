His medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and peptic ulcer disease. Due to his recurrent bleeding peptic ulcers, he does not take warfarin. His surgical history is significant for an appendectomy as a child. His medications include metformin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and omeprazole. He has a 50-pack-year history of smoking. His temperature is 37.6 C (99.7 F), blood pressure is 146/80 mm Hg, pulse is 115/min, and respiratory rate is 20/min. On physical exam, he is in acute distress due to the pain. Pulmonary auscultation reveals scattered wheezes and decreased air entry. His heart rate is irregularly irregular, with no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdominal exam is significant for decreased bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness. Initial laboratory evaluation is as follows:\nNa 138 mEq/L, Cl 101 mEq/L, HCO3 12 mEq/L, BUN 21 mg/dL, Cr 0.9 mg/dL, glucose 190 mg/dL, amylase 240 U/L (normal < 65 U/L).\n", "question": "What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?", "correct_ans": "acute mesenteric ischemia", "trial_0": {"multiturn_conversation": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI doctor specializing in Gastrointestinal System.
