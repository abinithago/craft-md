He describes food getting stuck down his windpipe and has been feeling very anxious around meal time because he is thinking that he may have esophageal cancer. He has had an influenza-like infection that lasted about 6 weeks in the past 3 months which exacerbated his asthma attacks. He used his puffers to relieve his symptoms and did not seek medical treatment. He is otherwise healthy. On examination, his blood pressure is 118/75 mm Hg, respirations are 17/min, pulse is 78/min, and temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F). There is no evidence of enlarged lymph nodes or a sore throat. On palpation, the thyroid gland is enlarged and tender. He is a non-smoker with a BMI of 25 kg/m2.
