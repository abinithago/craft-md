{"case_id": "case_2304", "case_vignette": "A 4-year-old girl presents to the office with her parents who are concerned about their daughter and slow, progressive changes in her behavior. The girl was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. She is up to date on all vaccines and was meeting all developmental milestones until about 2 years ago. At one point she had a vocabulary of several words and now she verbalizes in grunts. She also flaps her hands in a repeated motion and has difficulty walking. Her parents have tried several home therapies to improve their daughter's symptoms including restricted diets, hydrotherapy, and a variety of nutritional supplements. The vital signs include: heart rate 90/min, respiratory rate 22/min, blood pressure 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F). On physical exam, she is well nourished and stares absently out the window. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. She has mild scoliosis.
