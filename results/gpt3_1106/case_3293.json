However, 2 months ago, when he found out about the death of their mother, he showed little emotion and attended her funeral in jeans and a dirty T-shirt which upset the rest of their family. When asked about it, he shrugged and said he was in a hurry to get to the funeral and \u201cjust left the house with what I had on.\u201d He does not speak much during the interview, allowing his sister to speak on his behalf. His sister insists that he has \u2018always been like this\u2019, quiet and a complacent child who had no interest in playing with other children. The patient currently lives alone and spends his time repairing and building electrical appliances, and his sister is worried that his self-imposed isolation is making it \u2018impossible for him to interact with other people normally\u2019.
