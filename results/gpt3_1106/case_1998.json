She recently joined a volleyball team to try to get into shape as she was informed that weight loss would be beneficial for her at her last physical exam. She states that she has been repetitively pivoting and twisting on her knee while playing volleyball. The patient has a past medical history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and is currently taking oral contraceptive pills. Her temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/88 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals an obese woman with facial hair. Physical exam is notable for tenderness that is mediated with palpation over the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella. Her BMI is 37 kg/m^2. The rest of the exam of the lower extremity is not remarkable.
