Abdominal examination reveals a gravid uterus consistent with a gestational age of 32 weeks and a floating fetus in a cephalic presentation. Pelvic examination is performed which shows a closed firm cervix with no evidence of bleeding or discharge. Moderate pitting edema is noted and neurologic examination shows generalized hyperreflexia.
