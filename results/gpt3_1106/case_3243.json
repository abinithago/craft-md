The umbilical cord had 3 vessels and the placenta was tan-red with all cotyledons intact. Fetal membranes were tan-white and semi-translucent. The normal-appearing placenta and cord were sent to pathology for further evaluation. On physical exam, the newborn\u2019s vital signs include: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 60/44 mm Hg, pulse 185/min, and respiratory rate 74/min.
