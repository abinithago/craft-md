{"case_id": "case_254", "case_vignette": "A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of chest pain, dry cough, and shortness of breath. He describes two painless masses in his neck, which he says appeared 4 months ago and are progressively increasing in size. During this time, he has had week-long episodes of fever interspersed with 10-day periods of being afebrile. He reports that his clothes have become looser over the past few months. He drinks alcohol occasionally. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 105/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows two nontender, fixed cervical lymph nodes on either side of the neck, which are approximately 2.2 cm and 4.5 cm in size. The tip of the spleen is palpated 3 cm below the left costal margin. An x-ray of the chest shows discrete widening of the superior mediastinum.
