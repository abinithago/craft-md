She started to walk unassisted at 2 years and was not performing well at school. Physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate of 80/min, and temperature of 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u2109). On physical examination, the liver is enlarged, firm, and palpable up to the pelvis. The spleen and kidney are not palpable. Laboratory investigation reveals low blood glucose and pH with high lactate, triglycerides, ketones, and free fatty acids. The liver biopsy revealed high glycogen content. Hepatic glycogen structure was normal. The enzyme assay performed on the biopsy tissue revealed very low glucose-6-phosphatase levels.
