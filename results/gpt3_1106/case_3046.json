Her medical history is positive only for frequent bouts of sinusitis. She currently denies any smoking, drinks a glass of red wine/day, and she denies any past illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. Her physical examination shows decreased air movement throughout the right lung but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur, and a gravid uterus without acute findings. On physical examination, she is afebrile, tachycardic to 121/min, normotensive, and demonstrates an O2 saturation of 92%.
