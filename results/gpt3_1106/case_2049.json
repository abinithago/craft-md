{"case_id": "case_2049", "case_vignette": "A 27-year-old female presents to her primary care physician complaining of new hair growth on her face and lower abdomen over the last month. This has caused her to start shaving both areas. She also notes that she had not had acne since high school but has started to develop pimples on her face and back over the last several months. The patient\u2019s last menstrual period was over three months ago, and she states that her periods have been irregular over the last year. She does feel that she has been gaining weight recently, particularly in her abdomen. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and prediabetes with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.0% last year. At this office visit, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), pulse is 80/min, blood pressure is 139/88 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable, and the patient\u2019s abdomen appears slightly distended but exhibits no tenderness to palpation. The patient\u2019s face has coarse stubble along the jawline and on the upper lip, and there is similar hair along the midline of her lower abdomen. Pelvic exam reveals mild clitoromegaly, a normal anteverted uterus, and a large left adnexal mass that is mildly tender.
