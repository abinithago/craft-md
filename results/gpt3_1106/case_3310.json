He also mentions that over the last week he was frequently breathless and fatigued after walking a few blocks. He has had diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past 10 years, and his regular medications include metformin, glipizide, and lisinopril. However, he did not take his medications last week due to unplanned travel. Review of his medical records reveals an episode of acute viral hepatitis about 6 months ago from which he recovered well. His temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the pulse is 108/min, the blood pressure is 170/94 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, periorbital edema is present with pitting edema over both ankles and pretibial regions. Pallor and icterus are absent. Auscultation of the chest reveals crackles over the infrascapular regions bilaterally. Abdominal examination shows tender hepatomegaly.
