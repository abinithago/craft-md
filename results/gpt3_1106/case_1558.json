He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. His current medications are metformin and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a slightly erythematous stump with clean sutures. The skin overlying the stump is warm and well-perfused. Muscle strength and sensation are normal throughout the remaining extremity and the left lower extremity.
