{"case_id": "case_2977", "case_vignette": "A 6-week-old girl is brought to a pediatrician due to feeding difficulty for the last 4 days. Her mother mentions that the infant breathes rapidly and sweats profusely while nursing. She has been drinking very little breast milk and stops feeding as if she is tired, only to start sucking again after a few minutes. There is no history of cough, sneezing, nasal congestion, or fever. She was born at full term and her birth weight was 3.2 kg (7.0 lb). Her temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse rate is 190/min, and respiratory rate is 64/min. On chest auscultation, bilateral wheezing is present. A precordial murmur starts immediately after the onset of the first heart sound (S1), reaching its maximal intensity at the end of systole, and waning during late diastole. The murmur is best heard over the second left intercostal space and radiates to the left clavicle. The first heart sound (S1) is normal, while the second heart sound (S2) is obscured by the murmur.
