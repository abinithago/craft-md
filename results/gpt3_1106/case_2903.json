She actively avoids these areas to prevent an additional episode. She is afraid that during these attacks she may not be able to get the help she needs or escape if needed. No significant past medical history. The patient takes no current medications. Her grandfather died of a heart attack at the age of 70 and she is worried that it might run in the family.
