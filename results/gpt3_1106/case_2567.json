During intake, the patient talks non-stop about the government spying on him and his family, but provides little useful information besides his name and date of birth. Occasionally he refers to himself in the third person. He refuses to eat anything and will only drink clear fluids because he is afraid of being poisoned. A medical records search reveals that the patient has been treated for psychotic behavior and occasional bouts of severe depression for several years. Today, his heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 19/min, blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical exam, he appears gaunt and anxious. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative.
