{"case_id": "case_1907", "case_vignette": "A 23-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for knee pain. The pain started yesterday and has not improved since then. The patient is generally in good health. She attends college and plays soccer for her school's team. Three days ago, she was slide tackled during a game and her leg was struck from the outside. She fell to the ground and sat out for the rest of the game. It was not until yesterday that she noticed swelling in her knee. She also feels as if her knee is unstable and does not feel confident bearing weight on her leg during athletic activities. Her past medical history is notable for asthma, which is currently treated with an albuterol inhaler. On physical exam, you note bruising over her leg, knee, and lateral thigh, and edema of her knee. Passive range of motion of the knee is notable only for minor clicking and catching of the joint. The patient's gait appears normal, though the patient states that her injured knee does not feel stable. Further physical exam is performed and imaging is ordered.
