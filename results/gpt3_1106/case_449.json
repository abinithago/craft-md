He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for the last 45 years. His current medications include enalapril and metformin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. Muscle strength in the lower extremities is decreased. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is normal.
