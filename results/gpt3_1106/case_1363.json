I'm having a heart attack.\u201d He has been admitted to the hospital twice over the past week for evaluation of shortness of breath and abdominal pain but left the hospital the following day on both occasions. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol but is a known user of intravenous heroin. He has been living in a homeless shelter for the past 2 weeks after being evicted from his apartment for failure to pay rent. His temperature is 37.6\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. The patient seems anxious and refuses a physical examination of his chest. His cardiac troponin I concentration is 0.01 ng/mL (N = 0\u20130.01). An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes. While the physician is planning to discharge the patient, the patient reports numbness in his arm and insists on being admitted to the ward. On the following day, the patient leaves the hospital without informing the physician or the nursing staff.
