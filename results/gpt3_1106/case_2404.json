{"case_id": "case_2404", "case_vignette": "A 40-year-old man presents with substernal chest pain for the past hour. He describes the chest pain as severe, squeezing in nature, diffusely localized to the substernal area and radiating down his left arm. He also has associated nausea, dizziness, and diaphoresis. He denies any recent history of fever, chest trauma, palpitations, or syncope. Past medical history is significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), managed medically with a proton pump inhibitor for the last 3 months. He also has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypercholesterolemia diagnosed 10 years ago. His last HbA1c was 8.0. The vital signs include: blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, pulse 100/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.3\u00b0F) and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. He is administered sublingual nitroglycerin which lessens his chest pain. Chest radiograph seems normal. Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in anterolateral leads.
