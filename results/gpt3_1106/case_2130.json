{"case_id": "case_2130", "case_vignette": "A 65-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider for shoulder pain. She reports that she initially thought the pain was due to \"sleeping funny\" on the arm, but that the pain has now lasted for 4 weeks. She denies trauma to the joint and says that the pain is worse when reaching overhead to retrieve things from her kitchen cabinets. On physical exam, the patient's shoulders are symmetric, and the right lateral shoulder is tender to palpation. The shoulder has full passive and active range of motion, although pain is reproduced on active abduction of the right arm above 90 degrees. Pain is also reproduced on passively internally rotating and then lifting the shoulder. The patient is able to resist elbow flexion without pain, and she otherwise has 5/5 strength.
