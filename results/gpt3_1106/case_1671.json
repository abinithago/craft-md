{"case_id": "case_1671", "case_vignette": "A 78-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his son. He recently fell and now complains of pain over his ribs. He has also been less responsive lately and has been experiencing diarrhea. The patient lives alone in an apartment and has a past medical history of hypertension and dementia. His current medications include lisinopril, memantine, and donepezil. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. On physical exam, you note an uncomfortable elderly man. The patient responds to questions but his answers are inappropriate and he struggles to find the right words. Neurological exam is notable for an ataxic gait and nystagmus. Dermatologic exam is notable for scattered ecchymosis and the findings in Figure A. The patient is balding, and his hair seems very fragile and coiled. Cardiac exam reveals a systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids. Pulmonary exam reveals mild bibasilar crackles. Radiography is ordered as seen in Figure B. The patient is started on IV fluids.
