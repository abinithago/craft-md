Her audiology report one week prior showed that her hearing improved as expected by 20 decibels. However, she reports that she has occasional shooting pain with eating and when she wears earrings. She states that she has a stressful job as a cashier at the local department store and often sleeps poorly. She denies any neck pain or tenderness when she washes her face. On physical exam, no tenderness is elicited with preauricular or mandibular palpation bilaterally. No jaw clicking is heard. Right postauricular tapping causes tenderness in her right tonsillar area. Her molar teeth appear even and symmetric bilaterally. Her uvula is midline and her gag reflex is intact.
