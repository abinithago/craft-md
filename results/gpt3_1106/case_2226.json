The mother, a recent immigrant from El Salvador, delivered her child in the United States with an unclear prenatal history. Through a translator, she states that her child sleeps throughout the day and night but has also had three \"flu\" episodes during which the infant coughed and felt feverish. She managed each episode using traditional non-pharmacological remedies. She also states that because the baby sleeps so much, he rarely breastfeeds. On physical exam, the patient is 5th percentile for weight and height. He has a hyperinflated thorax and is tachypneic. Auscultation of the heart reveals a pansystolic murmur heard at the left lower sternal border and a diastolic rumble at the apex. Chest radiography is shown in Figure A.
