The patient has a past medical history of anabolic steroid use in high school. His current medications include a multivitamin, fish oil, and whey protein supplements. On physical exam, you note a muscular young man with male pattern hair loss. The patient has a loss of sensation bilaterally over the volar surface of the 4th and 5th digits and over the medial aspect of the volar forearm. The patient has 3/5 grip strength of his left hand and 2/5 grip strength of his right hand. There is also notable weakness of finger adduction and abduction.
