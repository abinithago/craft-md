{"case_id": "case_2688", "case_vignette": "A 21-year-old nurse starts to feel ill during his evening shift. Earlier this evening, he started his shift in his normal state of health. Past medical history is significant for multiple admissions to the hospital under strange circumstances. One time he presented to the emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain and gallstones, though no stones were identified and he was discharged after a full workup. Another time he was admitted for recurrent vomiting episodes and he was discharged after an EGD and several rounds of antiemetics. He has also visited an outpatient clinic for back pain and knee pain, though no findings were ever identified. He takes a multivitamin every day. His mother developed breast cancer at 47 and his father is healthy. Today, his blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 105/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F). On physical exam, he appears thin and anxious. He is diaphoretic with clammy hands. His heart is tachycardic with an irregular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. A urine toxicology test and EKG are negative. Random blood sugar is 45 mg/dL. The nurse is admitted and treated appropriately. After a thorough review of his medical records, the hospitalist assigned to this patient consults with psychiatry because she is concerned the patient may have factitious disorder.
