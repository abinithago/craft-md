Two weeks ago, she gave birth via vaginal delivery to a 9.5 lb (4.3 kg) male infant.

Immediately after delivery of the placenta she experienced intense shaking and chills that resolved within 1 hour. She has felt well since the delivery but admits to 6 days of malodorous smelling vaginal discharge that is tan in color. She has a history of vaginal candidiasis and is worried that it may be recurring.
