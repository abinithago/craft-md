She states that over the past two years his memory has been slowly declining though he has been able to take care of himself, pay his own rent, and manage his finances. However, two months ago she noticed a sharp decline in his cognitive functioning as well as his gait. Then one month ago, she noticed a similar decline in his functioning again that came on suddenly. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. His blood pressure is 165/95 mmHg, pulse is 82/minute, he is afebrile, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Cardiac exam reveals a crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard in the left upper sternal border that radiates to the carotids. Abdominal exam is benign, and neurologic exam reveals an unsteady gait.
