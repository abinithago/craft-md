{"case_id": "case_280", "case_vignette": "A 72-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife for forgetfulness, confusion, and mood changes for the past 4 months. His symptoms started with misplacing items such as his wallet and keys around the house. Two months ago, he became unable to manage their finances as it became too difficult for him. Last week, he became lost while returning home from the grocery store. His wife reports that he shows \u201cno emotion\u201d and that he is seemingly not concerned by his recent symptoms. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Current medications include aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and rosuvastatin. His pulse is 56/min and blood pressure is 158/76 mm Hg. Neurologic examination shows loss of sensation on his right leg and an unsteady gait. When asked to stand with his eyes closed and palms facing upward, his right arm rotates inward. An MRI of the brain shows multiple deep white matter lesions.
