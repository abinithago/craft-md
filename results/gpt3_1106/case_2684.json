He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day since he was 20. His current medical history involves hypertension. He takes enalapril daily. The vital signs include a blood pressure of 131/82 mm Hg, a heart rate of 95/min, and a temperature of 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F). On physical examination, splenomegaly is found. A complete blood count reveals thrombocytosis of 700,000 cells/m3. Lab work further shows decreased serum iron, iron saturation, and serum ferritin and increased total iron binding capacity. A blood smear reveals an increased number of abnormal platelets, and a bone marrow aspirate confirmed the presence of dysplastic megakaryocytes. A mutation on his chromosome 9 confirms the physician\u2019s suspicion of a certain clonal myeloproliferative disease. The patient is started on hydroxyurea.
