{"case_id": "case_2285", "case_vignette": "A 52-year-old woman visits your office complaining about discharge from her left nipple for the past 3 months. The discharge looks like gray greenish and its amount is progressively increasing. She appears to be anxious and extremely uncomfortable with this situation as it is embarrassing for her when it occurs outdoors. Past medical history is insignificant. Her family history is negative for breast and ovarian disorders. She tries to stay active by running for 30 minutes every day on a treadmill, staying away from smoking, and by eating a balanced diet. She drinks alcohol occasionally. During physical examination you find a firm, stable mass under an inverted nipple in her left breast; while on the right breast, dilated subareolar ducts can be noted. There is no lymphadenopathy and remaining of the physical exam is normal. A mammogram is performed which reveals tubular calcifications.
