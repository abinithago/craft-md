{"case_id": "case_790", "case_vignette": "Three days after undergoing coronary bypass surgery, a 67-year-old man becomes unresponsive and hypotensive. He is intubated, mechanically ventilated, and a central line is inserted. Vasopressin and noradrenaline infusions are begun. A Foley catheter is placed. Six days later, he has high unrelenting fevers. He is currently receiving noradrenaline via an infusion pump. His temperature is 39.6\u00b0 (102.3\u00b0F), pulse is 113/min, and blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg. Examination shows a sternal wound with surrounding erythema; there is no discharge from the wound. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. A Foley catheter is present. His hemoglobin concentration is 10.8 g/dL, leukocyte count is 21,700/mm3, and platelet count is 165,000/mm3. Samples for blood culture are drawn simultaneously from the central line and peripheral IV line. Blood cultures from the central line show coagulase-negative cocci in clusters on the 8th postoperative day, and those from the peripheral venous line show coagulase-negative cocci in clusters on the 10th postoperative day.
