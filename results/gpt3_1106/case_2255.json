His temperature is 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 87/48 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 27/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. A bedside ultrasound demonstrates an anechoic rim surrounding the heart with poor cardiac squeeze, global hypokinesis, and right ventricular collapse with pleural sliding. Laboratory values are notable for 2 cardiac troponins that measure 0.72 ng/mL and 0.71 ng/mL.
