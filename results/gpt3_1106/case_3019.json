He has been a smoker for the last 5 years.

His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the heart rate is 80/min, the blood pressure is 124/80 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 22/min. Auscultation of his chest reveals bilateral wheezing in the infrascapular regions. A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of his chest shows widespread abnormally hypoattenuating areas and simplification of lung architecture in both lower lobes. Pulmonary vessels are decreased in number and widely dispersed in both lower lobes.
