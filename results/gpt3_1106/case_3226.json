{"case_id": "case_3226", "case_vignette": "A 51-year-old woman presents the following significant and unintentional weight loss. She denies any personal history of blood clots in her past, but she says that her mother has also had to be treated for pulmonary embolism in the recent past. She also mentions that she had been struggling with her weight, so she was initially content with losing the weight, but her daughter convinced her to come to the office to be checked out. Her past medical history is significant for preeclampsia, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and she currently denies any illicit drug use, although she has a remote past of injection drug use with heroin. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min and irregular, and respiratory rate 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding and complexion is pale, but breath sounds remain clear. Oxygen saturation was initially 91% on room air and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation. Upon further discussion with the patient, her physician discovers that she is having some cognitive difficulty. Her leukocyte count is elevated to 128,000/mm3, and she has elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, and B-12 levels. A BCR-ABL translocation is present, as evidenced by the Philadelphia chromosome.
