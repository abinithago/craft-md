Past medical history is significant for a severe sore throat, fever, chills, and myalgia 1 month ago which resolved after a week. Her vital signs include: respiratory rate 22/min, temperature 37.7\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, pulse 90/min, and SpO2 88% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is ill-appearing with pallor and bilateral pitting edema of legs. The apex beat is prominently located in the 5th intercostal space in the mid-axillary line. Crepitus is noted over both lung bases bilaterally. A loud 3/6 pansystolic murmur is heard at the apex radiating towards the axilla. S3 and S4 sounds are noted at the left sternal border and cardiac apex.
