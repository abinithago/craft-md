{"case_id": "case_590", "case_vignette": "A 48-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because he has become increasingly restless and anxious. His wife says that he has seemed sad and irritable for the past 4 months. He lost his job as a store clerk because he often lied to avoid work, and spent most of his days on the phone placing bets on football games. He avoids all family-related events because he has borrowed money from most of his relatives. He is hopeful that his symptoms will improve once he is able to win some of his money back. He previously smoked 8\u201310 cigarettes daily but quit 1 month ago. He drinks beer on the weekends. On examination, he is uncooperative and dismissive. He is mildly tremulous.
