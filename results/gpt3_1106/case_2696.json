{"case_id": "case_2696", "case_vignette": "A 28-year-old man presented with gradually progressive gait disturbances since 10 years of age. His gait was clumsy and slow, and it was very difficult for him to perform brisk walking and running. After a few years, he developed tremors involving both upper limbs along with progressively increasing fatigability. Over the last several months, his friends have noticed that his speech has become slow, slurred, and sometimes incomprehensible. He has also developed difficulty in swallowing recently. On physical examination, he is vitally stable with normal sensorium and normal higher mental functions. The neurological examination reveals absent deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities and the extensor plantar response bilaterally. Muscle tone is normal in different muscle groups with significant distal muscle wasting in the extremities. There is a marked loss of vibration and position senses. His gait is ataxic and nystagmus is present. His speech is explosive and dysarthric. The neurologist suspected a specific condition and asked for genetic testing, which identified 2 GAA trinucleotide repeat expansions.
