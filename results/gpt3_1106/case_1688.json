The rash first appeared about 1 week ago. He has otherwise been well, and he has no known sick contacts. On exam he is afebrile and cooperative. His skin exam (Figure A) is notable for a single large, well-circumscribed pink plaque over his mid-abdomen, and many pink papules of varying sizes over his abdomen, back, and thighs. On follow-up a month later, the rash has largely resolved without intervention.
