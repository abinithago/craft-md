{"case_id": "case_2769", "case_vignette": "A 24-year-old man and his mother arrive for a psychiatric evaluation. She is concerned about his health and behavior ever since he dropped out of graduate school and moved back home 8 months ago. He is always very anxious and preoccupied with thoughts of school and getting a job. He also seems to behave very oddly at times such as wearing his winter jacket in summer. He says that he hears voices but he can not understand what they are saying. When prompted he describes a plot to have him killed with poison seeping from the walls. Today, his heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). On physical exam, he appears gaunt and anxious. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative.
